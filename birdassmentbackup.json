Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.",
        "trend_justification": "The population trend has not been investigated, but declines in this forest dependent species are suspected on the basis of ongoing deforestation in large parts of the range. Over three generations (12.9 years), 5-7% of tree cover is lost within the range (Global Forest Watch 2023, using Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). This value however does not account for the impacts of habitat fragmentation and degradation. Consequently, population declines may be larger than the rate of tree cover loss suggests. Overall, population declines are here tentatively placed in the band 1-19% over three generations. Nevertheless, the population may locally be stable, as vast areas of pristine habitat remain (see Global Forest Watch 2023).",

S. Kretzschmar<em> in litt.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. In 1973 and 1975, it was readily found in groups of 2-5 (Heather 1977)<strong></strong>. In 1990, a total of 235 birds were located (Thorpe<em> et al.</em> 1990)<strong></strong>, and the total population was estimated at 3,000-6,000 pairs (J. S. Kretzschmar <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. &#160;<p></p>",
        "population": "The population is roughly estimated to number 3,895 mature individuals based on systematic point counts carried out in 2018 and 2019 (Operation Wallacea 2020, J. England<em> in litt. </em>2020), placed here in the band 3,000-5,000 mature individuals to account for some uncertainty.",
        "habitats": "It inhabits wet, mature rainforest in fairly high abundance. Forest pockets, logged forest and plantations close to intact forest hold individuals at much lower densities (Thorpe<em> et al.</em> 1990, J. S. Kretzschmar<em> in litt.</em> 1998, Operation Wallacea 2020)<strong></strong>. It feeds on small arthropods and worms in the leaf-litter and insects in the lower canopy (Clunie 1984)<strong></strong>. All nests found by England (2019) were 5-10.5 m off the ground (far higher than found in the Taveuni Silktail) in the same species of tree (<em>Atuna racemosa</em>), in wet, mature forest. Two nests were found in very close proximity of each other. Seemingly uniparental incubation and care by the female (England 2019).",
        "threats": "Although the rate of conversion of old-growth native forest to mahogany plantations has slowed significantly,&#160;logging and subsistence farming still persist within the range (Anderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160;The majority of recently observed forest clearance has been for the (sometimes large scale) cultivation of kava (<em>Piper methysticum</em>), which is now a high value crop and widely traded and sold in the region (J. England&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020, O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2021). Farmers are continuing to move deeper into the forests to clear patches of land to grow kava (Operation Wallacea 2020). Conversion of forest to pasture for cattle ranching and livestock grazing is an additional threat (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2021). Invasive species may also be contributing to population declines in this species (J. England&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020), facilitated by ongoing habitat disturbance.&#160;Small Indian mongoose (<em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>) density across the peninsula is extremely high (population estimate of 175,000-400,000), with high abundances even in mature forest (Kerr 2018). Whilst no direct observation of Natewa Silktail nest predation by mongoose has been recorded in Fiji, the mongoose has the ability to climb and is known to have caused many avifaunal declines across its range (Morley and Winder 2013). Pacific rat (<em>Rattus exulans</em>), Brown rat (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) and other invasive species within the range also present a possible threat (J. England <em>in litt.</em> 2020, M. O'Brien <em>in litt.</em> 2023). The presence of these invasive species significantly degrades biodiversity and habitat quality (Morley and Winder 2013) which presents a serious conservation issue given the species’ preference for undisturbed forest (J. England <em>in litt.</em> 2020).",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is protected under Fijian law. There is a Community Conservation Area around the IBA, however at present there is very little evidence of any active management within this area (J. England <em>in litt.</em> 2020). Long-term standardised surveys are being conducted yearly to better understand population trends, habitat associations and general behavioural ecology (Operation Wallacea 2020).<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Determine population trends, incorporating training of people from local communities in survey techniques. Reinvigorate education, engagement and awareness of the threat to the species within local communities (SPREP 2000, J. England <em>in litt.</em> 2020). Influence agricultural practices and protect remaining tracts of mature forest (J. England <em>in litt. </em>2020). Facilitate a framework which makes conservation an acceptable alternative to kava cultivation (O'Brien <em>et al. </em>2021). Focus study on the impact of invasive species, namely mongoose and rats, to guide possible control or eradication measures (J. England <em>in litt. </em>2020).<p></p>",

        "rationale": "This species has a small population restricted to the Natewa Peninsula where it is thought to be declining primarily due to the ongoing loss and degradation of its habitat. It is therefore assessed as Vulnerable.<p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "This species is heavily reliant on mature forest. It is recorded at higher densities in least disturbed habitat and records in disturbed habitat and mahogany plantations are always in close proximity to mature forest (Operation Wallacea 2020). Although the rate of conversion of old-growth native forest to mahogany plantations has slowed significantly,&#160;logging and subsistence farming still persist within the range (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2017). However, this appears to be largely undetected by remote sensing data which indicate only minimal forest loss within the range (Global Forest Watch 2023, using data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] and methods disclosed therein). The majority of recently observed forest clearance has been for (sometimes large scale) cultivation of kava (<em>Piper methysticum</em>), which is now a high value crop and widely traded and sold in the region (J. England <em>in litt. </em>2020, O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2021). The species is thought to no longer occur in areas where forest has been cleared, for example it can no longer be caught in areas where mist nets were erected in 2017 which are now further from forest due to agricultural expansion (M. O'Brien <em>in litt.</em> 2023). Invasive species may also be contributing to population declines in this species (J. England <em>in litt.</em> 2020), facilitated by ongoing habitat loss and disturbance. The most recent population estimate of 3,895 mature individuals also suggests a decline in the population given it was previously placed in the band 6,000-12,000 mature individuals (J. S. Kretzschmar&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2000).",
        "taxonomic_notes": "Jønsson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2018) establish that Cerulean Paradise-flycatcher&#160;<em>Eutrichomyias rowleyi</em>, Drongo Fantail<em>&#160;Chaetorhynchus papuensis</em>, Natewa Silktail&#160;<em>Lamprolia klinesmithi</em>&#160;and Taveuni Silktail&#160;<em>L. victoriae</em>&#160;belong in a separate ancient family, Lamproliidae, sister to the Rhipiduridae. This finding is accepted here.<br/><br/><em>Lamprolia victoriae</em> and <em>L. klinesmithi</em> (del Hoyo and Collar   2016) were previously lumped as <em>L. victoriae</em> following Sibley &amp; Monroe (1990, 1993)."

        "range": "This species<em>&#160;</em>occurs widely in the <strong>Northern Mariana Islands (to USA)</strong> and on Yap in the <strong>Federated States of Micronesia.  </strong>It has become extirpated from Guam (to USA) owing to predation by the introduced Brown tree snake&#160;<em>Boiga irregularis. </em>The species is a&#160;capable disperser, with birds occasionally recorded on Guam despite it no longer occurring there, though the continued presence of tree snakes is thought to be preventing the species from re-establishing.<p></p>",
        "population": "It appears to be common on Saipan where the population was estimated at 11,800 (7,468-16,862) birds in 2007 (Camp <em>et al</em>. 2009). The most recent estimate on Tinian was 4,479 (3,077-6,193) birds in 2013 (Spaulding <em>et al. </em>2022) and on Aguigan the population was estimated to number 548 (291-892) birds in 2008 (Amidon<em> et al. </em>2014). The population on Rota was estimated at 3,576 (2,602-4,758) individuals in 2012 (Camp&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). The populations on each of the smaller, more northerly Mariana islands have not been quantified but the species is described as uncommon here (Gibbs <em>et al</em>. 2001) and on Guguan it was noted as the 'least abundant terrestrial species' (J. Bradley, on eBird [2023]), with fewer than 25 birds detected in extensive surveys. The population on Yap was estimated at <em>c.</em>200 birds in 1984 (Engbring&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1990) although, based on descriptive investigations of eBird (2023) data, this may have been overly pessimistic.&#160;Accumulating these data and accounting for the fact that only a proportion likely refer to mature individuals, the population is estimated to fall within the range 10,000-19,999 mature individuals.",
        "habitats": "The species inhabits native forest, secondary forest, plantations, introduced Tangan-tangan <em>Leucaena leucocephala</em> thickets and habitat mosaics including fields, but is reportedly more frequent in native forest than in disturbed habitats (Engbring <em>et al.</em> 1982, Jenkins 1983, Engbring <em>et al.</em> 1990, Craig 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is largely arboreal; it feeds in the forest canopy taking fruits, seeds and flowers, though on Yap it feeds mainly on the ground (van Perlo 2011).   <p></p>",
        "threats": "This species was extirpated from Guam owing to predation by the introduced brown tree snake&#160;<em>Boiga irregularis. </em>The greatest threat to the species would therefore come from the accidental introduction of <em>B. irregularis</em> to other islands in its range, however the robust biosecurity measures in place are believed to have thus far prevented the snakes from becoming established (see, e.g., Yackel Adams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). This species has been hunted traditionally, though this is no longer legal. Current prevalence is unknown but some hunting pressure is thought likely (Camp&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). As the species is able to adapt to secondary habitats, at least in the short term it is not thought to be significantly affected by habitat loss (Baptista <em>et al. </em>2020).",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/><span lang=\"EN-US\">Biosecurity measures are in place to prevent establishment of <em>B. irregularis</em>. A captive breeding conservation program was established by officials of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (H. Roberts<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> in litt. </span>2009).&#160;&#160;&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Monitor populations.  Protect areas of habitat which support good numbers of the species.  Continue to undertake biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of <em>B. irregularis </em>to islands within the range. Further develop the captive breeding programme to support future reintroductions and supplementation.<br/><p></p>",
        "use_trade": "This species has been hunted traditionally, though this is no longer legal. Current prevalence is unknown but some hunting pressure is thought likely (Camp <em>et al. </em>2012).",
        "rationale": "This species is classified as Near Threatened due to its restriction to a small number of islands, where the introduction of Brown Tree Snakes <em>Boiga</em><em>&#160;irregularis </em>to Saipan, Tinian or Rota&#160;could rapidly drive it to Vulnerable or Endangered.<p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "Compared to 1982 estimates, surveys suggest the species has declined on Rota but increased on Aguiguan, Saipan, and Tinian (Camp <em>et al.</em> 2009, Amidon <em>et al.</em> 2014, Camp <em>et al.</em> 2016, Spaulding<em> et al</em>. 2022), though the reasons for this are unclear. However, these islands require up-to-date population estimates and there is a lack of information from other islands within the species' range. The population trend is therefore considered to be unknown.",
        "taxonomic_notes": "Previously (del Hoyo and Collar 2014) placed in the genus <em>Alopecoenas</em> (as <em>A. xanthonurus</em>) and before that in the genus<em> Gallicolumba </em>but transferred to <em>Pampusana</em> on the grounds of the latter’s priority (Bruce <em>et al.</em> 2016)."

        "population": "The species is described as uncommon to fairly common (Stotz <em>et al</em>. 1996, Remsen Jr. and Kirwan 2020). It is suspected that subspecies <em>pabsti </em>numbers around 15,000 mature individuals (G. A. Bencke <em>in litt</em>. 2021, in Silveira <em>et al</em>. 2023). Based on intensive field surveys, the population of subspecies <em>espinhacensis </em>was estimated at 880-2880 mature individuals (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2019). The total population is therefore placed in the band 15,880-17,880 mature individuals.",

There are also records from urban areas and along roadsides (J. F. Amorim <em>in litt</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. It can persist for over two years after an area is planted with <em>Pinus</em>, but it is displaced by the time the trees have reached 7 m (I. Accordi <em>in litt</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. <p></p>",
        "threats": "This species is threatened by habitat conversion into plantations of <em>Pinus</em>, eucalyptus and soja across much of its range (Silveira <em>et al</em>. 2023). Further threats include livestock grazing and conversion to agricultural land, burning, mining, as well as the development of tourism infrastructure (ICMBio 2018). The species' habitat is highly vulnerable to climate change; it is estimated that about 50% of campos rupestres may be lost by 2080 (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2019 and references therein).<br/><br/><br/><p></p>",

S. Fontana <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt</span>. 2006, Remsen Jr. and Kirwan 2020, Silveira<em> et</em> <em>al</em>. 2023). Based on remote sensing data, it is estimated that the more numerous subspecies <em>pabsti </em>has lost 20% of suitable habitat to plantation between 2010 and 2020 (Silveira <em>et al</em>. 2023 and references therein), which equates to 22% over three generations (11.1 years). Climate change may further reduce available habitat, as campo rupestre savannas are particularly vulnerable to alterations in precipitation regimes (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2019 and references therein). It is assumed that population declines are roughly equivalent to the rate of habitat loss (Silveira <em>et al</em>. 2023). Consequently, they are here placed in the band 20-29% over three generations and are suspected to continue into the future based on ongoing threats.",

        "range": "Historically, the species' breeding range extended across the Eurasian steppes, from Portugal all the way to the Pacific coast of Russia and the Korean Peninsula (Kessler 2022, Kessler and Batbayar 2023). Currently, this species<em>&#160;</em>breeds in <strong style=\"\">Portugal</strong>, <strong style=\"\">Spain</strong>, <strong style=\"\">Austria,</strong>&#160;<strong style=\"\">Germany</strong>, <strong style=\"\">Slovakia</strong>, <strong style=\"\">Hungary</strong>, <strong style=\"\"></strong><strong style=\"\"></strong><strong style=\"\"></strong><strong style=\"\"></strong><strong style=\"\">Serbia, </strong><strong style=\"\">Romania</strong>,&#160;<strong style=\"\"></strong><strong style=\"\"></strong><strong style=\"\"></strong><strong style=\"\">Türkiye</strong>,&#160;<strong style=\"\">Russia,</strong>&#160;<strong style=\"\">Ukraine</strong>, <strong>Kazakhstan,</strong> and <strong style=\"\">China</strong>, as well as in&#160;<strong>Morocco</strong>,&#160;<strong>Iran&#160;</strong>(West Azerbaijan province [Barati&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015]), western Siberia, western and northern&#160;Kazakhstan,<strong>&#160;</strong>and western&#160;<strong>Mongolia</strong>&#160;where only isolated populations remain, many of which are at high risk of extinction (Alonso and Palacín&#160;2022, Kessler 2022, Kessler and Batbayar 2023). A reintroduction scheme is currently taking place in the United Kingdom.<br/><strong style=\"\"><br/></strong>The species' range is becoming increasingly disjunct, with rapid declines and population extinctions in parts of eastern and central  Europe (<span style=\"font-weight: bold; \">Bulgaria</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; \">, Poland, Moldova</span>, <strong>Czechia</strong>), and the species is considered at risk of extinction or already extirpated in the majority of areas between west-central Türkiye to Nei Mongol (China) (Palacín and Alonso 2008, Kessler and Collar 2022, Kessler and Batbayar 2023).&#160;Over the past half century, the species has only rarely been sighted in <strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong>, <strong>Tajikistan </strong>and <strong>Azerbaijan</strong>, where it once bred (M. Kessler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Despite occupying a large proportion of the species' range, the population in Central Asia now only represents 1% of the global population (Kessler 2022).&#160;<br/>These declines have been accompanied by a range contraction, due to the disappearance of smaller populations across the species' range, as recently highlighted in Keller&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2020).&#160;<br/>Nevertheless, thanks to considerable conservation effort, the species' breeding population has increased in West and East Pannonia, and in Romania, due to the dispersal of the Pannonian populations (Alonso and Palacín&#160;2022, Kessler 2022).&#160;<br/><br/>Most populations of the western subspecies are at least partially migratory, depending on weather conditions, and occur on passage or in winter in Ukraine, <strong>Iraq,</strong> Kazakhstan and <strong>Uzbekistan</strong> (Y.  Andryushchenko <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2017; Kessler 2015, 2022; M. Kessler <em>in litt</em>. 2016, K. Ararat <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2023). Birds from northern Central Asia used to overwinter in large numbers in <strong>Turkmenistan</strong>, as well as Azerbaijan and north-east Iran, but sightings are now rare in these countries, due to the crash of the Central Asian population in the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Kessler and Smith 2014). Southern Central Asian breeding grounds in southern and south-eastern Kazakhstan, and areas in Uzbekistan, however, still serve as staging grounds and sometimes as overwintering sites, and these currently hold the largest numbers of Great Bustards during migration (Kessler 2022). The eastern subspecies, which breeds in Mongolia, eastern Russia, and north-east China is fully migratory, spending four months on migratory stopovers and four months on wintering grounds, which used to extend to the Korean Peninsula and can still be found as far south as central China, although more birds are now overwintering in breeding grounds in northern China (Kessler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, M. Kessler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016, Kessler and Batbayar 2023).",
        "population": "Two revised estimates of the global population were published in 2022. Alonso and Palacín (2022) collated national estimates from across the species’ range, producing a total of 30,693–35,402 birds. Kessler (2022) did the same but included the results of more recent surveys in Asia and elsewhere, reporting a total of 29,060–32,449 birds. Combining these sources by using the most recent national estimates from them both, and an even more recent estimate from Morocco (Alonso&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2023), yields a figure of 29,638–33,027, rounded to a range of 29,600-33,000.<br/>A breakdown of this total includes (broadly from west to east): for the western subspecies <em>O. t. tarda</em>,<em>&#160;</em>72-78 birds in Morocco in 2022 (Alonso <em>et al.</em>&#160;2023), 939 birds in Portugal in 2021&#160;(Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e das Florestas and Liga para a Protecção da Natureza 2018 [unpublished data]), 22,000-24,000 birds in Spain in 2019 (Palacín and Alonso 2021), 315 birds in&#160;Germany in 2022 (LIFE Great Bustard 2022), 634 birds in&#160;West Pannonia (which here includes Austria, western Hungary, and Slovakia) in 2022&#160;(LIFE Great Bustard 2022), 1,495 individuals in East Pannonia (which here includes central and eastern Hungary, Romania and Serbia) in 2022 (LIFE Great Bustard 2022),&#160;<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>559-780 individuals&#160;in&#160;Türkiye in 2019<strong>&#160;</strong>(Özgencil <em>et al.&#160;</em>2022), 33-35 birds in&#160;Iran&#160;in 2016-2017 (Abdulkarimi 2022), 225-300 birds in&#160;Ukraine in 2015<strong>&#160;</strong>(Andryushchenko 2009, Beskaravainyi 2015 <em>per&#160;</em>Kessler 2022), 1,870 birds in European Russia in 2021 (Oparina and Oparin 2021), 179-364 birds in Central Asia (including Asian Russia and Kazakhstan) in 2014-2016 (Kornev and&#160;Gavlyuk 2019, Rustamov 2022, Kashkarov&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2022, Muratov and&#160;Talbonov 2022, Kulagin 2022, Shakula&#160;<em>et al.</em><em>&#160;</em>2022a, Koshkin&#160;<em>et al.</em><em>&#160;</em>2022, Kessler and&#160;Bidashko 2022, Nefedov 2022,&#160;<em>per&#160;</em>Kessler 2022), and 17 individuals in north-west China in 2016 (Wang and&#160;Yang 2022); for the eastern subspecies <em>O. t. dybowskii</em>,<em>&#160;</em>1,300-2,200&#160;individuals across its range, which includes Mongolia, south-east Russia and northeast China (Kessler&#160;<em>et al.</em><em>&#160;</em>2021, Kessler and Batbayar 2023). Based on the above numbers, the species' Spanish population currently represents&#160;<em>c.</em>&#160;74% of its global population size.<br/>A&#160;reintroduction scheme is underway in the United Kingdom, with 67 individuals in 2021 (Kessler <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021) and almost 100 individuals in 2022 (Great Bustard Group 2023), but this is currently considered a managed subpopulation and does not form part of the assessed population as yet.",
        "habitats": "This species was originally mainly associated with Eurasian steppe, but it has acclimated to agricultural landscapes (M. Kessler <em>in litt</em>. 2016), and can now be found in open, flat or somewhat rolling landscapes, usually with short sward height and a mixture of preferably low-intensity farmland activities and crops (cereals, vineyards, fodder plants, as well as fallow fields, pastureland and steppic grassland) (J. C. Alonso<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">&#160;in litt</span>. 2012, Collar and Garcia 2020). In Iberia, it also occurs in Cork Oak <em>Quercus suber </em>and Holm Oak <em>Q. ilex</em>&#160;dehesas, and in olive groves (Collar and Garcia 2020). In Asia, it can also be found in <em>Artemisia&#160;</em>and <em>Stipa</em>&#160;steppes, mountain foothills and in semi-desert habitats (Gubin 2007 <em>per&#160;</em>Kessler and Batbayar 2023). The eastern subspecies inhabits both open steppe and forest steppe, including small forest openings, and using trees as sources of shade and food (Mel’nikov and Popov 2000 <em>per&#160;</em>Kessler and Batbayar 2023, Raab <em>et al</em>&#160;2014, M. Kessler <em>in litt</em>. 2016), and are more often found in wet habitats such as river islands and moist meadows (Kozlova 1975, Ponomareva 1986, Goroshko 2002, Goroshko 2008&#160;<em>per&#160;</em>Kessler and Batbayar 2023). <br/>Its diet comprises invertebrates, plants and seeds, as well as small vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds (Collar and Garcia 2020, Kessler and Batbayar 2023).&#160;<br/>Areas with little or no disturbance and abundant supply of insects are required for successful breeding (Y. Andryushchenko <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Nest sites are selected in grassland, fallow or cereal fields (Rocha <em>et al. </em>2013) (primarily alfalfa in Central Europe and wheat in Russia, Mongolia and Kazakhstan [M. Kessler <em>in litt</em>. 2016]) in areas of low patch-type diversity, far from human infrastructure, and with good horizontal visibility (Magaña <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al. </span>2010). The eastern subspecies nests primarily in agricultural mosaics, open steppe, and adjacent to forest edge (Kessler 2015), and utilises areas around international borders for both breeding and migratory stopover sites, as well as, possibly, wintering grounds too (Kessler and Batbayar 2023). The species exhibits highly variable migratory behaviour across populations, including obligate winter migrants (majority of Asia), short-distance migrants (Iran), facultative migrants (central European populations) and partial winter and summer migrants with differential migratory pattern by sex (Iberian populations) (Morales <span style=\"font-style: italic; \">et al. </span>2000, Alonso <span style=\"font-style: italic; \">et al. </span>2000; Palacín <span style=\"font-style: italic; \">et al. </span>2009, 2011; Kessler 2022). The species gathers in large wintering flocks in Central Asia (Kessler 2022).",
        "threats": "Key threats are increased habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss due to agricultural intensification, land-use changes such as agricultural expansion and intensification, and infrastructure development, which have accelerated in both Europe and Asia, and could be compounded by climate change and the species' naturally low reproductive rate. Collisions with powerlines are expected to increase with the expansion of the renewable energy network across vast swathes of the species’ Asian range (Nagy 2018, Alonso and Palacín 2022,&#160;Kessler 2022, Kashkarov&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2023, Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2023).&#160;<br/>Changes in land use have the potential to increase following land privatisation in eastern Europe (S. Nagy <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2007, Nagy 2009)<strong style=\"\"></strong>&#160;and Central Asia and is occurring in China (Chan and Goroshko 1998, M. Kessler <em>in litt</em>. 2016)<strong style=\"\"></strong>. Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation continues as a result of the ploughing of grasslands, overgrazing, afforestation (Sterbetz 2000) and the increasing development of irrigation schemes, roads, powerlines, fencing, and ditches (Nagy 2018). Agricultural machinery, chemical fertilisers, fire and predation all contribute to high mortality in eggs, chicks, juveniles and incubating females, while chemical pesticides,&#160;also lower the food resources needed for chick development&#160;(Nagy 2009, 2018; Rocha <em>et al. </em>2013, Alonso and Palacín 2022, Kessler 2022). Unintentional poisoning from agricultural chemicals has recently increased in Eastern Europe (e.g. Kessler 2021), and unintentional effects on the species' endocrine system from agrochemicals may lower its reproductive rate and success (Kessler and Batbayar 2023). The expansion of urban and industrial areas can also lead to habitat loss, and road networks can also degrade the species' habitat as well as create disturbance for the species (Osborne&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Palacín 2007, Torres <em>et al. </em>2011, Raab <em>et al. </em>2014). Disturbance, either during the display or nesting periods, reduces the reproductive rate of the species (Nagy 2018).<br/>&#160;<br/>Hunting is a major threat in Morocco,&#160;Türkiye, China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Mongolia (Y. Andryushchenko <em>in litt.</em> 1999, Chan and Goroshko 1998<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">, </span>P. Goriup <em>in litt. </em>2007, Karakaş and Akarsu 2009; M. Kessler <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt. </span>2012, 2016; M. M. Karataş&#160;&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016), and is expected to intensify as the paved road network expands, increasing access to the species' habitats (e.g. in Mongolia), but also as access to firearms becomes easier (Kessler and Batbayar 2023). International tourists are known to shoot the species in Eastern Europe, and Central and East Asia (M. Kessler <em>in litt</em>. 2016, Nagy 2018), despite the ban on hunting in all range countries (Nagy 2018, Kessler and Batbayar 2023). In some countries (e.g., Russia) hunting is organised and advertised online (Nagy 2018). Illegal killing therefore remains a critical threat in these regions, with the exception of Iran and Xinjiang, China (Kessler 2022, Özgencil&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2022), and especially where larger wintering flocks occur, as their killing can heavily impact the small breeding populations from which they originate (Kessler 2022). The species is also vulnerable to the indiscriminate poisoning of wild birds for food trade in China (M. Kessler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016, Kessler and Batbayar 2023), and egg collecting in Iran (Naderi 2017 <em>per&#160;</em>Kessler and Batbayar 2023).&#160;Disturbance from hunting or poaching in winter on or nearby the species' wintering grounds, as well as disturbance, mainly from cars and walkers in Spain cause negative impacts on the birds' fitness and abundance in those areas (Sastre <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Nagy 2018).<br/><br/>Collision with powerlines and wind turbines are also a major threat to the species, and the highest cause of mortality in adults in Europe, and a threat which is likely to increase and expand over the species' range&#160;<em></em>(J. C. Alonso <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2016; Alonso <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016a, Nagy 2009, M. Kessler<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> in litt.</span> 2012, S. Nagy <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt. </span>2012, Raab&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Barrientos <em>et al</em>. 2012, Vadász and Lóránt 2015, Palacín <em>et al.</em> 2017, Alonso 2014 <em>per&#160;</em>Kessler and Batbayar 2023). The impacts of climate change may increasingly affect the species (Nagy 2009, Alonso <em>et al. </em>2016b), with harsh winter weather causing adult mortality and heavier summer rainfall leading to loss of clutches (M. Kessler <em>in litt</em>. 2016, Nagy 2018), but also with increasing wildfires contributing significantly to habitat loss and potentially nest destruction, if occurring during the breeding season (Bold 2003, Malkov 2012 and&#160;Yi Y Liu <em>et al.</em> 2013&#160;<em>per&#160;</em>Kessler and Batbayar 2023).&#160;Predation, particularly by domestic dogs <em>Canis lupus domesticus</em>,&#160;also plays a role in the species' decline (Kessler 2022, Kessler and Batbayar 2023), but the impact of other non-native predators is not clear (Nagy 2018). The predation, especially of eggs or chicks by native mammalian and avian predators (Nagy 2018) in unbalanced ecosystems can also limit the species' populations.<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I and II, CMS Appendix I and II and CMS MoU for Middle-European Populations in place since 2002 (with the fifth Meeting of the Signatories taking place in September 2023 [CMS 2023]), as well as the CMS Action Plan for the Great Bustard in Asia to be formally adopted in 2024 (Kessler and Batbayar 2023, update from the action plan for east Asian populations [Chan and Goroshko 1998]). EU Wild Birds Directive Annex I, Bern Convention Annex II. <br/>A European action plan was published in 1996 and updated in 2009 (Nagy 2009) and more recently adapted for the Middle-European Populations MoU (Nagy 2018). In addition, a 'Concerted Action' for the species was established among Asian range states in 2017 (Government of Mongolia <em>et al.&#160;</em>2017<em>&#160;per&#160;</em>Kessler and Batbayar 2023). An action plan for Morocco was produced in 2016 (IUCN and HCEFLCD 2016) and in Türkiye an action plan was published in 2004 (Doğa Derneği ve T.C. Çevre ve Orman Bakanlığı, Doğa Koruma ve Milli Parklar Genel Müdürlüğü 2004).&#160;Agri-environmental and land management programmes have been implemented in Spain, Portugal, Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Serbia.<br/>Monitoring of populations occurs in many range countries, e.g. across the EU and Europe (BirdLife International 2021) and across Türkiye (M.M. Karataş&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Hunting of the species is prohibited in all the range states of the Middle-European Populations MoU, and range states in Asia (Nagy 2018, Kessler and Batbayar 2023), as well as in the European Union and in Türkiye since 1977.&#160;<br/>Artificial incubation and chick rearing projects have been established in Germany and Hungary since the 1970s. A UK reintroduction project began in 2003 with chicks and eggs imported from the Russian Federation and later eggs from Spain (Dawes 2008, Great Bustard Group 2023) that has established a small population, with first successful nesting and chicks fledging in 2009 (Burnside&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). A LIFE + project was established in 2010 (European Commission 2021), which continued the release and monitoring of the species, the selection of two new release sites, protection from threats, and establishing agro-environmental schemes and land management advice to farmers, as well as a long-term management strategy. Chicks ceased to be imported in 2022 (N. Collar <em>in litt</em>. 2023), but management is still needed in the form of removing and incubating eggs from nests in fields being harvested and releasing the hatched chicks once the harvest is over (Stubbs 2020, N. Collar <em>in litt</em>. 2023).&#160;<br/>A LIFE Nature project for the species was implemented in Hungary during 2004-2008 with the aim of increasing in-situ protection of the species (Bankovics and Lóránt 2008). Other LIFE projects for the species have been implemented in Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria and Slovakia (e.g. LIFE Great Bustard 2022). Indeed, continued and intensive conservation actions in the West Pannonian population (Germany, Austria, and Hungary) have led to significant increases in this population, as well as in Romania, due to the dispersal from this increasing West Pannonian population. Using powerline markers and using underground cables instead of over-head powerlines have been shown to reduce mortality in this species (Raab <em>et al. </em>2012). Accurate distribution maps of the species (e.g. in Spain) is assisting the sensitive development of renewable energy infrastructure (Palacín <em>et al.</em>&#160;2023).<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The continued coordination of conservation actions between range states in Asia, where the species is fully migratory, but also uses habitats around international borders is essential, as is the increase in enforcement of sanctions for illegal killing of the species (M. Kessler <em>in litt.</em> 2016, Kessler and Batbayar 2023). Overall, international communication on the species is important (Kessler 2022). Media campaigns should be undertaken to engender pride and concern towards this species, including encouraging volunteering (Kessler and Batbayar 2023).<br/>Conduct nationwide surveys in countries with currently low-quality estimates. Research limiting factors, and investigate its vulnerability to climate change, metapopulation dynamics and the causes of reproductive failure in East Asia (M. Kessler <em>in litt. </em>2016). Continue research on wintering distribution. Research wintering movements in eastern and south-eastern Anatolia (M.M. Karataş&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/>Protect and manage breeding, wintering and stop-over areas. Identify any remaining breeding sites in Central and East Asia, as well as upgrade existing and establish new protected areas in this region (M. Kessler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Lek sites over the species' range should be recorded and protected (Kessler and Batbayar 2023). Establish protected areas and strict conservation measures in Morocco, the only African population of the species (J. C. Alonso&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).<br/>Implement agri-environment measures for low-intensity farming. The maintenance of biodiversity friendly farming systems (e.g., High Nature Value [HNV]), with a high diversity of land-use types, is essential for the conservation of the species (Palacín&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Prevent steppe fires and stubble burning.&#160;Re-route or bury overhead cabling at areas in which Great Bustards gather, in order to prevent collisions with powerlines (M. Kessler <em>in litt. </em>2016). Renewable energy infrastructure should be sited taking into account the landscape scale use by the species and in particular the locations of leks (e.g. in Spain [Palacín&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2023]).&#160;<br/>Particular conservation focus should be placed on southern Kazakhstan, as the species occurs there in breeding, passage and wintering seasons, and Uzbekistan, which can host the majority of the species' Central Asian population in winter (Kashkarov <em>et al</em> 2022 <em>per</em> Kessler 2022). Raise public awareness of the population declines and importance of the current key sites.",
        "use_trade": "The species is hunted for subsistence at a local and national levels, as well as sport at local, national and international levels, particularly in Eastern Europe and Asia, which can have severe impacts on wintering Great Bustard population, and may increase as access to firearms and to the species' habitats become easier (Nagy 2018, Kessler and Batbayar 2023).",
        "rationale": "This species has suffered rapid population reductions across most of its range owing to the loss, degradation and fragmentation of its habitat due to agricultural intensification and industrial expansion (including energy development), with climate change exacerbating these effects through increased frequency of extreme weather events and wildfires. In addition, illegal killing, elevated predation rates and disturbance are contributing to declines, with increased access to and division of the species' habitats by expanded and upgraded road networks compounding these threats. Population declines are currently estimated to be rapid, but are projected to become very rapid in the near future and over the next three generations. Accordingly Great Bustard is assessed as Endangered.&#160;<br/><p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "Substantial evidence exists documenting the historical decline and disappearance of this species across much of its range,&#160;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">with </span>recent data collated by Alonso and Palacín&#160;(2022) and Kessler (2022) confirming that this decline is continuing. Alonso and Palacín&#160;(2022) estimated that the global population declined by <em>c.&#160;</em>34% (30–38%) between 2005 and 2018, with an annual rate of -3.23%; declines were highest in China and European Russia (89% and 72%, respectively), with significant declines also seen in Portugal (-50%), and in Spain (-28%). The latter was noted as an important change compared to previous national trend data which previously estimated the population in the country as either stable to slightly increasing. Repeating this analysis including the more updated national population estimates from Kessler (2022) yields a decline of <em>c.&#160;</em>36% (25–46%) between 2004 and 2019, which equates to an annual decline of <em>c. </em>3% (2–4%). Extrapolating this rate of decline to three generation lengths suggests a decrease of <em>c</em>. 65% (49–75%), however, these calculations assume that the rate of decline has been constant over time, which is not the case for this species.&#160;Similarly, in the species’ major eastern European stronghold, population declines accelerated to reach a rate of reduction of <em>c.</em> 70% (Andryushchenko 2020, Oparin and Oparina 2020). <br/><br/>The accelerating rate of decline in recent years means it is not justifiable to backcast current rates of decline into the past, but it is reasonable to extrapolate them into the future. As such, a rate of population reduction of 49–75% is assigned to the three-generation period between 2004 and 2040, and the range of 25-46% is kept for the past three generations. <br/>Key threats, such as increased habitat degradation, fragmentation, and loss due to land use change and agricultural expansion and intensification, as well as unintentional poisoning and collisions with powerlines, have&#160;or are expected to increase in both Europe and Asia, and could be compounded by climate change (Kessler 2021, Kessler and Collar 2022, Kashkarov&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2023, Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2023). Illegal hunting also remains a potent threat (Kessler 2022, Özgencil&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2022). Accordingly the current rate of decline is projected to continue into the future, at a rate of 50-79% over three generations.<br/><br/><p></p>",

Surveys in 2002 and 2011 placed&#160; the population at c.140 individuals (I. Hahn, P. Hodum and M.

However, surveys using a different methodology during 2006-2007 estimated a population similar to the <em>c</em>. 500 individuals counted 20  years previously (Tomasevic <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 2010). As there is currently no evidence of declines or increases, the population is here tentatively placed in the band 140-500 individuals, which roughly equates to 90-330 mature individuals. An exact quantification of the current population is however urgently required.",
        "habitats": "This gleaning insectivore is found primarily in <em>Dicksonia externa</em> fern forest, and has a strong association with canelo <em>Drimys confertifolia</em>, an endemic species of tree. It also regularly occurs in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Lophosauria quadripinnata</span> dominated slopes in the upper elevations of the island (P. Hodum <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt. </span>2012). It is most common along stream courses where luxuriant <em>Dicksonia</em> grows to a height of 5 m. There are records at elevations as low as 600 m, but it occurs primarily above 800 m (Hahn and Römer 1996)<strong></strong>. It is typically skulking and found in pairs or family groups (P. Hodum <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012).<br/>The species has a minimum territory size of 4 ha per pair in optimal habitat, although most are larger due to poorer habitat quality; nests are placed in natural and man-made cavities, particularly in small natural holes in steep rocks (Hahn <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2004, 2010, 2011; P. Hodum <em>in litt</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2007, 2008)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Nesting occurs from late November to early February and fledglings have been noted in January and February (P. Hodum <em>in litt</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2006, 2012; Hahn <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2011)<strong></strong>. <br/><p></p>",
        "threats": "It is probably secure as long as mature tracts of the ferns <em>Dicksonia</em> and <em>Lophosauria</em> remain intact, but a large proportion of natural vegetation on the island has been degraded and fragmented by goat-trampling, fire and timber-cutting (I. Hahn <em>in litt</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">. </span>2004, Hahn <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">. </span>2004, Anon. 2007)<strong></strong>. The species does not occur in degraded and disturbed areas (Remsen Jr. <em>et al</em>. 2020). Significantly, it is absent from the lowlands, where the forest understorey has already been destroyed. <br/>Introduced mammalian predators are thought to have a significant impact on the population, with rats (<em>Rattus</em> spp.) and possibly mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) impacting on brood survival, and feral cats impacting on juvenile and adult survival (Hahn and Römer 2002, Tomasevic <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 2010, Oikonos undated). Invasive plants (notably Chilean Guava <em>Ugni molinae</em>, Elmleaf Blackberry&#160;<em>Rubus ulmifolius</em>&#160;and Maqui <em>Aristotelia chilensis</em>) further degrade available habitat (Oikonos undated). An unusual increase of native Red-backed Hawk&#160;<em>Geranoaetus polyosoma</em>&#160;during the last decades, as illegal hunting of this species by fishermen has ceased and the hawk population has benefited from preying upon introduced mammals, may have contributed modestly to any recent declines, with several cases noted of hawks preying on rayaditos (I. Hahn <em>in litt</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2004, Hahn <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">. </span>2004<strong></strong>).<br/><p></p>",

Study the species to gain a better understanding of its reproductive biology. Establish a continuous monitoring scheme of the species' population and its reproductive success.<br/>Continue the eradication of introduced taxa, in particular rats and  mice, feral cats, goats and invasive plant species. Continue habitat restoration efforts by establishing canelo&#160;<em>Drimys confertifolia&#160;</em>seedlings  and increasing the area covered by canelo trees.

        "range": "<em>Loriculus pusillus</em> is endemic to Java and Bali, <strong>Indonesia</strong>.<p></p>",
        "population": "The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is described as generally uncommon throughout its range (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997, Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021) and recent records span much of Java and Bali where forest remains (eBird 2023). Nonetheless, it is evidently scarce, being observed in only nine (0.4%) of 2,417 surveyed grid squares (although many only partially) during the BigMonth2020 citizen science project (Squires <em>et al</em>. 2021) and having a relatively low average encounter rate of 0.11 (birds/groups per hour) on mountains across Java (Marsden <em>et al</em>. 2023).",
        "habitats": "It inhabits lowland, swamp and montane forests to 1,800 m;&#160;it is also tolerant of plantations and agricultural land where near forest (Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021).<p></p>",
        "threats": "Historically, the widespread clearance of lowland forest on Java undoubtedly caused wide-ranging declines on the island, with the species now remaining only in well-forested areas (although it is evidently tolerant of degradation and secondary forests (Eaton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021, eBird 2023). However, forest cover loss on Java this century has been minimal (Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Higginbottom&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, Global Forest Watch 2023), and the only contemporary threat thought to be driving declines in this species is capture for the cagebird trade. There is evidence for increasing demand of this species for the cagebird trade over the past decade, and this is suspected to be driving moderately rapid population declines. Market data show a possible increase in demand from&#160;<em>c</em>.2016/2017, broadly in line with an increase in cagebird ownership on Java over the past decade (cf. Jepson and Ladle 2009, Marshall&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). For example, an inventory of a Jakarta market found none in July 2014 but 68 in July 2019 (Anon.&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2021); while a survey of Bali bird markets found 11 in 2017, but 52 in 2018 (Chng&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160; Other surveys on Java similarly reported previously low numbers: one at Bandung market in September 2016 and only two in East Java in 2015 (Chng and Eaton 2016).

(2020) found only a single bird kept among 3,000 households. There is no evidence that this species is traded internationally, with most, if not probably all, the demand for this Indonesian (Java and Bali) endemic coming from within the species' native range.<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>This species is listed in CITES Appendix II and is ostensibly protected under Indonesian national law.<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Regularly monitor at certain sites throughout its range to accurately determine population trends. Protect significant areas of suitable forest on Java and Bali. Adequately enforce regulations of hunting and trade to avoid precipitous population declines.<p></p>",
        "use_trade": "This species is targeted for the cagebird trade, perhaps in place of other, now much rarer, Indonesian parrots. It is also sometimes used as a training bird for White-rumped Shama <em>Copsychus malabaricus </em>singing competitions (Okarda <em>et al</em>. 2022). The extent to which demand for this species is driving wild population declines is enigmatic. Symes&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2018) assigned probability curves according to expert opinion on trade desirability in conjunction with accessibility (based on a distance to forest edge from remote sensed forest data) to determine possible rates of population loss over the next three generation period across the entire range of the species. The estimated reduction for this species was 49%, but this analysis had no term to account for reproduction and was largely speculative. Evidence for an increase in&#160; desirability for this species is however presented by some market data, which show a possible increase in demand from&#160;<em>c</em>.2016/2017, broadly in line with an increase in cagebird ownership on Java over the past decade (cf. Jepson and Ladle 2009, Marshall&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). For example, an inventory of a Jakarta market found none in July 2014 but 68 in July 2019 (Anon.&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2021); while a survey of Bali bird markets found 11 in 2017, but 52 in 2018 (Chng&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). Other surveys on Java similarly reported previously low numbers: one at Bandung market in September 2016 and only two in East Java in 2015 (Chng and Eaton 2016). Conversely, Okarda&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2022) found none for sale among 284,118 birds listed online between April 2020 and September 2021, and Marshall&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2020) found only a single bird kept among 3,000 households.<br/>There is no evidence that this species is traded internationally, with most, if not probably all, the demand for this Indonesian (Java and Bali) endemic coming from within the species' native range.",
        "rationale": "This small, charismatic parrot is endemic to Java and Bali, Indonesia, where an apparent increase in demand for it in the cagebird trade is thought to be causing moderately rapid declines. Since approximately 2016, these declines are thought to have approached the threshold for listing as threatened; the species is therefore assessed as Near Threatened. Monitoring to determine the impact of the cagebird trade on wild populations is urgently needed to more precisely determine ongoing rates of decline.",
        "trend_justification": "Suspected to be declining, perhaps moderately rapidly, although the evidence base for this precautionary assumption is weak. Historically, the widespread clearance of lowland forest on Java undoubtedly caused wide-ranging declines on the island, with the species now remaining only in well-forested areas (although it is evidently tolerant of degradation and secondary forests (Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021, eBird 2023). However, forest cover loss on Java this century has been minimal (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2013, Higginbottom&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, Global Forest Watch 2023), and the only contemporary threat thought to be driving declines in this species is capture for the cagebird trade.<br/>Symes&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2018) assigned probability curves according to expert opinion on trade desirability in conjunction with accessibility (based on a distance to forest edge from remote sensed forest data) to determine possible rates of population loss over the next three generation period across the entire range of the species. The estimated reduction for this species was 49%, but this analysis had no term to account for reproduction and was largely speculative. Evidence for an increase in desirability for this species is however presented by some market data, which show a possible increase in demand from <em>c</em>.2016/2017, broadly in line with an increase in cagebird ownership on Java over the past decade (cf.

While scarcity in markets/households is sometimes caused by a complete collapse in wild birds (i.e. the source), <em>Loriculus pusillus </em>remains commonly encountered across most forested areas it might be expected (eBird 2023), with a compilation of citizen science datasets (Squires <em>et al</em>. 2021, eBird 2023) finding that the species does not appear to have been extirpated from any site since 2016.<br/>Determining a rate of decline for this species is therefore exceedingly difficult, but the rate of&#160;–49% over three generations suspected by Symes <em>et al</em>. (2018) appears overly pessimistic. However, the trajectory of apparent increasing demand for the species is concerning, and accordingly the species is suspected to decline at a rate of 15–29% over the next three generations (13 years: 2023–2036) and in the window 2016 to 2029, thus approaching the thresholds for listing as threatened under criteria A3d+4d.",

        "range": "<em>Mulleripicus pulverulentus </em>is found in South-East Asia, from northern <strong>India</strong> through the foothills of the Himalaya (including, locally, <strong>Nepal </strong>and <strong>Bhutan</strong>)&#160;to southern <strong>China</strong>,<strong> Myanmar</strong>, <strong>Lao PDR</strong>,<strong> Viet Nam</strong>, <strong>Cambodia</strong> and <strong>Thailand</strong>, and through Peninsular <strong>Malaysia</strong>&#160;to Sumatra (<strong>Indonesia</strong>), Borneo,&#160;and Palawan,&#160;<strong>Philippines</strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2002, Inskipp <span style=\"font-style: italic; \">et al. </span>2011, Allen 2020, eBird 2023). It previously bred in Singapore, with the most recent historic observation made in 1949; since, there have been records in 2018 and 2023, but there is no evidence the species has yet recolonised as a breeding bird and here it is still considered a vagrant (Bird Society of Singapore 2023).<p></p>",
        "population": "The global population size of this species was estimated by Lammertink <em>et al</em>. (2009) to lie somewhere in the broad range of 26,000 to 550,000 mature individuals, a figure derived from an initial remote-sensing based analysis which yielded an estimate of 260,000-550,000, but with an adjusted lower bound (reduced by 90%) to reflect occupancy and the insensitivities of the land cover data used. If these numbers were accurate for 2005 as proposed, then the suspected population decline of 25-49% (best estimate 35–49%) since 2005 (see Population Trend text) yields an adjusted total in 2023 of 13,260–412,500 (best estimate 13,260–357,500). A bespoke internal analysis using land cover data from 2010 (with totals adjusted for forest loss rates since) and an approximate density of 0.5–5 birds/km<sup>2</sup> (reflecting a range of densities recorded by Lammertink <em>et al</em>. [2009] and by Kumar and Shahabuddin [2012]) suggests a similar global population of 12,750–63,750. This alternative total is congruent with the scenarios provided by Lammertink <em>et al</em>. (2009) but suggests that their more pessimistic scenarios were likely more accurate. Accordingly, but reflecting the great uncertainty in the population size of this species, the total is set here to 10,000-70,000 mature individuals.",
        "habitats": "<strong>Behaviour </strong>This resident species breeds between March and June in the west of its range and without a distinct season in South-East Asia (Lammertink 2004; see Kumar and Shahabuddin 2012)<strong></strong>. Clutch size is two to four eggs. Nest-hole excavation, incubation and chick-rearing are conducted by both sexes, with helpers at some nests. It forages in noisy groups of three to six individuals and sometimes more (Lammertink 2004)<strong></strong>. Groups occupy large territories. It is not a migrant, &#160;however, in areas of its distribution that show a marked seasonality (e.g. Himalayan foothills) the home range appears to expand locally during winters (Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2011). <br/><strong>Habitat</strong> It occupies primary semi-open moist deciduous and tropical evergreen old growth, lower elevation forests, as well as adjacent secondary forest and clearings with scattered tall trees. It prefers dipterocarp (e.g. Shorea robusta in Himalayan foothills [R. Kumar <em>in litt. </em>2016])&#160;and teak forests in certain areas, as well as swamp-forest and tall mangroves. It is most frequent in lowlands and lower hills below 600 m, but does occur up to 1,100 m in the Himalaya and occasionally up to 2,000 m. <strong><br/>Diet </strong>Foraging groups search and exploit nests of social insects (ants, termites, and stingless bees), often in trunks and branches of old live trees. Birds may also take small fruit (Lammertink 2004)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>",
        "threats": "The chief cause of rapid declines in this species has been the loss and degradation of forest within its range (Lammertink <em>et al</em>. 2009). The scale and cause of this varies in different countries, but almost nowhere in its range is totally removed from the overarching threat. In the Greater Sundas (especially lowland Borneo and Sumatra), the principal driver of forest cover loss has been the industrial-scale removal of forest, initially for timber extraction, but motivated in part or in whole by the replacement of these forested areas with large-scale plantations, especially oil-palm and rubber. More locally, this is compounded by localised shifting agriculture and timber extraction, the latter especially targeting larger, hollow-bearing trees needed by this species. The damage caused in Indochina has ostensibly been lesser, with rates of overall forest cover loss incomparable to those in the Greater Sundas (Global Forest Watch 2023); however, here selective logging and clearance for agriculture has been pervasive, rendering remaining stands of forest among the least intact in Asia (Grantham <em>et al</em>. 2020). Concerningly, this has been most acute in the deciduous dipterocarp forests in the lowlands favoured by this species, especially in Cambodia and southern Lao PDR, and in both countries rapid declines are suspected to have occurred over the last 20 years, and even by then the species' population size was only a small fraction of its historic baseline. In Lao PDR, and possibly also Myanmar and Viet Nam, gun and projectile hunting is thought to have contributed to (at least historic) declines (M. Lammertink&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2012, Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press). Moreover, in Lao PDR, hydroelectric power plants have flooded considerable areas of lowland forest (Soukhaphon <em>et al</em>. 2021). In Myanmar, Bangladesh and parts of India, selective logging, even in nominally protected areas, continues and presumably is driving (at least slow) population declines as elsewhere in the species' range, although data are sparse. In the Himalayan foothills, clearance for sal&#160;<em>Shorea robusta&#160;</em>plantations continues and is likely driving slow declines (Kumar and Shahabuddin 2012), although these are not typically in global strongholds.",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>No current action is known for this species, although it does occur in many protected areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2023)<strong></strong>.<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Assess density responses to forest disturbance in the Indochinese forest complex (<strong></strong>Lammertink&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009)<strong></strong>.  Continue to monitor populations on the ground to better understand the  impacts of selective logging. Continue to monitor rates of forest loss,  and forest integrity, using remote sensing data. The principal action needed is the (effective) protection of remaining lowland blocks of forest, especially in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar, all of which likely host a significant proportion of the global population of this species. Stop selective logging in mature stands of sal&#160;<em>Shorea robusta&#160;</em>in Himalayan foothills (Kumar and Shahabuddin 2012). Increase forest connectivity throughout its range.<br/><p></p>",
        "use_trade": "In most of its range, probably not used or traded. In parts, however, especially Lao PDR (where hunting pressure is extremely high), and perhaps more locally in Myanmar and Viet Nam, gun and projectile hunting is thought to have contributed to (at least historic) declines (M. Lammertink&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2012, Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press).",
        "rationale": "This species is listed as Vulnerable as it has suffered a rapid population decline over the past 20 years (three generations) due to loss of primary forest cover throughout much of its range. However the true rate of decline may be greater than currently estimated, and evidence of such declines would result in the species being uplisted in the future. <p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "Few direct population data exist this species, although it has evidently declined, probably rapidly, in response to the large-scale clearance and degradation of its forest habitat through most of its range (Lammertink <em>et al</em>. 2009). Remote sensing data suggest that forest cover in this species' range has reduced by <em>c</em>.16–21%&#160; over the past three generations (17 years: 2006–2023) (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein).<br/>Alone therefore, remote sensing data indicate a rate of population decline much lower than that proposed here. However, there are several reasons to believe that population declines in this species are (perhaps substantially) more rapid than satellite data alone suggest. In some parts of its range (especially Lao PDR, and perhaps locally in Myanmar and Viet Nam), gun and projectile hunting is thought to have contributed to (at least historic) declines (Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press); this species is vocal and easy to locate, rendering it particularly vulnerable to local areas where there is a high propensity to hunt larger-bodied species. Likely more impacting, however, is the threat of selective logging and habitat degradation that is undetectable to unsensitive remote sensing analyses. This species is dependent on old growth forests with large diameter trees for nesting (Lammertink <em>et al</em>. 2009). Selective logging for these trees<strong>—</strong>an activity that has increased rapidly with increasing access to even formerly remote forest blocks—is considered to be capable of driving declines possibly greater than outright forest loss. Data to evidence this assumption are few (in part because of its low detectability as a threat), however in Lao PDR, repeat surveys from some sites provides 'strong evidence for serious declines in the species' (Timmins <em>et al. </em>in press, and references therein). This threat is believed to occur across a wide area of this species' range, and is particularly pervasive in lowland dipterocarp deciduous forests of southern Indochina, where densities of this species is high in unaltered habitat (eBird 2023) and large areas of suitable habitat are either not formally protected, or ineffectually so.<br/>The minimum rate of global population decline over the past three generations (17 years: 2005-2023) is set at 25%, representing an optimistic scenario where selective logging is not as serious a threat as suggested by Timmins <em>et al</em>. (in press) and/or it is not as reliant on old growth forests as suspected (Lammertink <em>et al</em>. 2009). The upper bound is set to 49%, representing a scenario where a disproportionate of this species' population occurs in areas most impacted by selective logging. There is high confidence that the true rate of decline lies somewhere between these two scenarios, with a best estimate (given the evidence of localised extirpation/density reduction in Lao PDR: Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press) that a pessimistic scenario (declines of 35-49%) is probably more likely. The same rates of decline are also suspected in the future, with selective logging considered a threat so difficult to control (even in protected areas) that there is a high likelihood that such rapid declines will also occur over the next three generations (17 years: 2023-2040). Whether the rapid declines suspected will ever be reversed is unclear: Timmins <em>et al</em>. (in press) suggest that population recoveries may take decades, if not centuries, to occur.",

        "range": "Restricted to native forest on the island of&#160;Príncipe, <strong>São Tomé and Principe</strong>, this has one of the smallest distributions of any owl. All records come from within Príncipe Obô Natural Park in the south of the island with most from lower elevation natural forest, within a range from 62-407 m above sea level (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2023). The lack of records above 500 m above sea level may indicate that it is genuinely absent from&#160;the highest forested parts of the island (Freitas&#160;<em>et al. </em>2022) and the elevation range is here given as 50-500 m. The area of occupancy (AOO) of the species is 64 km<sup>2</sup>, with the estimated range of 34.4 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Freitas <em>et al. </em>2022, 2023) falling within 16 2 km x 2 km grid squares. A minimum convex polygon around the distribution in Freitas <em>et al. </em>(2022) is slightly smaller than this, at 55 km<sup>2</sup>, hence the extent of occurrence (EOO) for the species is matched with the AOO at 64 km<sup>2</sup>. Both of these values exceed those given in Freitas <em>et al. </em>(2023) due to the latter using a different methodology to that specified in the Red List Guidelines (IUCN 2022). The proposed construction of a dam, ongoing development and&#160;small-scale illegal logging, along with the impacts of introduced mammals are inferred to be causing a continuing decline in the area, extent and quality of habitat for the species despite the range being within a protected area (R.F. de Lima <em>in litt. </em>2022, Freitas <em>et al. </em>2022). However, there is insufficient evidence to infer a continuing decline in either EOO, AOO or the number of mature individuals given the estimated suitable habitat encompasses the extent of the native forest, which is currently stable, and direct population impacts of introduced mammals are not available.",
        "population": "The population has been estimated using distance sampling based on point counts detecting calling individuals (assumed to be mature) during the short dry season which is assumed to be the breeding season (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2022). Two models performed similarly but resulted in distinct estimates, hence both were used resulting in densities of either 33.4 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: 23.6-47.2) or 46.4 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (29.3-73.6) and population estimates of 1,149&#160;individuals&#160;(813-1,623) or 1,597&#160;individuals (1,007-2,533) (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2022). It is noted that this estimate is based on the probable occurrence of the species to the highest elevations: if the elevation is restricted to below 500 m Freitas <em>et al. </em>(2022) indicate the population size would be 200 individuals smaller.",
        "habitats": "Principe Scops-owl appears highly dependent on the remaining intact areas of native forest (Freitas&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2023). There are some records from mature secondary forests, where these are adjacent to native forest (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2023). It appears to be more abundant at lower elevations and the highest recorded record is 402 m, despite higher elevations being surveyed (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2023), suggesting that is associated primarily with lowland tropical moist forest and especially large trees. The area, extent and quality of this habitat is inferred to be declining within the range of the species, despite falling within the Príncipe Obô Natural Park,&#160;due to ongoing small-scale illegal logging and clearance for agroforestry, loss to small-scale development and potentially to a larger proposal for the refurbishment and upgrading of a hydro-electric facility along the&#160;Papagaio River (R.F. de Lima <em>in litt. </em>2022, Freitas <em>et al. </em>2023).&#160;It is assumed to be sedentary and to feed on insects (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2023). It has been found in holes in large trees by parrot trappers and local knowledge suggests that it may displace African Grey Parrots from nest sites (Melo and Dallimer 2009), which are likely to be a limiting resource for both species (Valle <em>et al. </em>2020).",
        "threats": "Principe Scops-owl appears to be associated with large trees and to occur within an adjacent to native forest, hence any loss of intact native forest is likely to impact its population size. Large areas of Principe's forest were cleared for sugar plantations from as early as the 16th century, with these often then converted to other plantations for coconuts or coffee (Jones and Tye 2006). However, recent deforestation is almost non-existent within the Príncipe Obô Natural Park where this species occurs. Since the declaration of the island as a Biosphere Reserve in 2012 the local government promotes the area as a leading example of sustainable development in action and illegal logging is rare (de Lima <em>et al</em>. 2016). However, small areas of the forest are reported to have been lost as a consequence of development within this boundary (Freitas 2019, R. F. de Lima <em>in litt. </em>2022, Freitas <em>et al. </em>2023). A particular concern is the proposal for a hydroelectric dam along the Papagaio River (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2023) which flows northeast through the protected area. The extent of the footprint of the development is unclear, but has the potential to affect a small but significant section of suitable habitat (for approximate location see Anon. 2023).<br/><br/>A number of introduced mammal species are present within the range of the species including Black Rat&#160;<em>Rattus rattus</em>, African Civet&#160;<em>Civettictis civetta</em>, feral cats&#160;<em>Felis catus</em>&#160;and Mona Monkey&#160;<em>Cercopithecus mona</em>&#160;(Fundação Príncipe 2019), with the latter documented to target the nests of Principe Thrush <em>Turdus xanthorhynchus </em>(Guedes <em>et al. </em>2021) which is assessed as Critically Endangered (BirdLife International 2021) and&#160;which overlaps in distribution with Principe Scops-owl (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2023). The climbing ability of the monkey suggests that the development of nest-raiding is a pervasive threat across the whole range of both these bird species. The Mona Monkey population on Principe was apparently virtually exterminated in the early 20th century, but was present across most of the island by the end of that century and was referred to as vermin in plantations as early as 1958 (Dutton 1994). It is therefore likely, though untested, that the Mona Monkey population in the remote areas of Principe increased in recent decades. While predation has not been demonstrated for nests of Principe Scops-owl, it is plausible from the observed apparent predation of a Principe Thrush nest and predation of experimental nests with quail eggs by Mona Monkeys (Guedes <em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). Black Rats were probably established on Principe around 1500&#160;and quickly became widespread (Dutton 1994), hence although a potential severe nest predator and capable of accessing almost all nests, the scops-owl has persisted alongside rats for over 500 years. If eggs are occasionally taken, it would not seem to be at levels likely to cause significant population declines. There is a theoretical potential threat to the species from feral cats through additional mortality, though there is no evidence for this. Cats have been implicated in the extinction of one owl subspecies, <em>Micrathene whitneyi graysoni </em>from the island of Socorro, but that was in conjunction with severe overgrazing by introduced sheep (Ortiz-Alcaraz <em>et al. </em>2019). The present species is considered at far lower risk of significant impacts from cat predation within intact native forest, and the opportunity for such predation is probably very limited. The civet is a poor climber and not likely to affect this species.<br/><br/>The abundance of the native Grey Parrot <em>Psittacus erithacus</em>&#160;on Principe (Valle <em>et al. </em>2020) is suggested as a potentially affecting the population size of the species and the two species appear to be each others' main competition for suitable nest holes in the protected area of native forest (Freitas 2019, Freitas <em>et al. </em>2023). However, existing knowledge of the <em>Otus</em>&#160;on Principe is that it is the owl that occupies parrot nesting cavities rather than the other way around (Melo and Dallimer 2009). Reports from those familiar with the birds of the forest prior to the recent formal description of the species relate to scops-owls found in holes being searched for nesting Grey Parrots (Melo and Dallimer 2009). As a natural relationship, there seems little evidence for this representing a direct threat to the species nor of it being modified by human actions to become one.",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>Príncipe was recognised as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 2012, and it appears virtually the entire species range falls within the Príncipe Obo Natural Park. It shares this range with Principe Thrush <em>Turdus xanthorhynchus </em>for which a single species conservation action has been developed: this includes a requirement for population monitoring that has been implemented through transect survey. There are ongoing projects supporting Biodiversity Conservation, Protected Area management, and sustainable management of forests in Sao Tomé and Príncipe, like the ECOFAC6 initiative 2018-2022.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct regular distance sampling surveys to generate population and  occupancy trend information for this species as for Principe Thrush<em>. </em>Develop a single species conservation action plan for <em>Otus bikegila</em>, or produce an updated combined species action plan<em>&#160;</em>to complement and reinforce conservation actions for Principe's threatened bird species. Monitor nests to evaluate threat posed by Mona Monkey <em>Cercopithicus mona</em>. Investigate the feasibility of reducing densities of Mona Monkey in collaboration with local hunters in core areas of the range of the scops-owl (Freitas <em>et al.</em> 2023).

        "range": "The species occurs in southeast <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong> (DR Congo) and northern and western parts of northeast <strong>Zambia</strong>&#160;south the the Bangweulu area. Two subspecies are recognised, with the very poorly known&#160;<em>P. katangae upembae&#160;</em>occurring around Upemba National Park in DR Congo, while the nominate occurs around Lake Mweru east to a small portion of the south western shore of Lake Tanganyika (around Nsumbu and Nkamba bays at least) and separately in suitable parts of the Bangweulu Game Management Area. There is no indication that the range of the species has changed over recent decades (Craig <em>et al. </em>2022). Due to the difficulty in accessing Upemba National Park there have been no records of this subspecies for more than a decade and there are few specimens. It is known from only three sites within the Upemba marshes; Bukama, Mabwe and Kadia but also non-breeding individuals were collected away from marshes at Kiambi and Manono (Louette and Hasson 2009, Craig <em>et al. </em>2022). Birds in non-breeding plumage from areas further south may also refer to this taxon, as may a report from Lake Tanganyika (Louette and Hasson 2009), though this is within the range of the nominate. Boundaries for the latter are also poorly known and masked-weavers seen further south in Zambia may be this species (Dowsett <em>et al. </em>2008), suggesting potential occurrence over a larger range than so far documented.",
        "population": "This is a poorly known species and no population estimates are available. It remains relatively easy to encounter at known sites such as Bengweulu (eBird 2023), though does not congregate in large numbers. The area of apparently suitable habitat for the species is large and very poorly surveyed, suggesting that the population is unlikely to be small despite the restricted range. There is no evidence that the area of suitable habitat has reduced significantly at known sites, many of which are protected. Given the lack of information available the population size is considered unknown.",
        "habitats": "It breeds in freshwater swamps with extensive reed and papyrus at elevations of between 500 and 1,500 metres. Nests may be in small colonies or may be solitary: apparently sociality is unknown in the Upemba subspecies (Fry and Keith 2004). The nominate is suspected to be polygynous (Fry and Keith 2004, Craig <em>et al. </em>2022). Flocks of non-breeding birds have been recorded up to 7 km from water in miombo woodland but may also remain in swamps year round (Fry and Keith<em>&#160;</em>2004, Dowsett <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008, Craig <em>et al. </em>2022).",
        "threats": null,
        "measures": null,
        "use_trade": null,
        "rationale": "Although the range of this species is moderately restricted, it exceeds thresholds for listing as threatened under the range size criterion. The population trend is not known, but the population is not suspected to be decreasing sufficiently rapidly to approach the thresholds under the population trend criterion. The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to be very small and there is insufficient information to infer a continuing population decline. The largest uncertainties remain around population size which requires additional sampling effort, and trend which requires monitoring at known sites. Given the wide availability of appropriate habitat in multiple separate and extensive areas, and lack of clear direct threats to the species, it is judged that should the population size prove to be below 10,000 mature individuals, it would still not meet appropriate sub criteria for listing as threatened. For these reasons Katanga Masked-weaver is evaluated as Least Concern.",
        "trend_justification": "At the known sites for the species habitat extent appears to be largely unchanged over at least several decades and there do not seem to be direct threats operating that may be driving population reductions. However, given the lack of information from Upemba and low level of coverage elsewhere in the range the current population trend is considered unknown, but is not suspected to be suffering a rapid reduction.",
        "taxonomic_notes": "<em>Ploceus katangae</em> was formerly split as <em>P. katangae</em> and <em>P. upembae</em> (del Hoyo and Collar 2016), which were previously lumped as <em>P. katangae</em> following Sibley and Monroe (1990, 1993). However, further data needed to confirm the specific status of <em>upembae</em>, which was first described as a subspecies of <em>P. velatus</em>. Form <em>upembae</em> differs from <em>katangae</em> its pale olive-green nape merging with mantle vs yellow nape demarcated sharply from olive-green mantle by vague narrow blackish line (2); reduced black on front of head, resulting in narrower forehead and not extending around eyes (2); mantle to rump and wing-coverts plain yellowish olive-green, without blackish streaks and edgings (2); females and eclipse males dorsally washed olive vs warm brownish (Louette 1987) (ns1); larger bill (8.4–8.7 mm vs 7–7.6 deeper, 6.5–7.1 vs 5.5–5.9 wider and 18 vs 17.2 longer (Louette 1987); allow 2). In the past often considered conspecific with <em>P. velatus</em>, <em>P. ruweti</em>, <em>P. reichardi</em> and <em>P. vitellinus</em>. Two subspecies recognised."

        "range": "The species breeds from eastern <strong>Tajikistan </strong>to central <strong>China</strong>, south to the foothills of the northern Himalaya, with some ostensibly outlying breeding areas in north-west <strong>India</strong>&#160;and eastern <strong>Afghanistan</strong>. It then migrates on a broad front, with <em>pamirensis</em>&#160;wintering along the east and south coasts of Africa through to the Middle East and probably the west coast of India; subspecies <em>atrifrons</em>&#160;moves directly south from its central breeding areas to winter from the Indian Subcontinent to Sumatra, <strong>Indonesia</strong>; subspecies <em>schaeferi </em>winters in South-East Asia, the Greater Sundas and probably much of Indonesia (although many observations from here may refer to <em>atrifrons</em>; more research needed).",
        "population": "Based principally on expert opinion, Wetlands International (2022) estimated the global populations of the three subspecies of <em>C. atrifrons</em> to be 120,000-150,000 (nominate), 30,000 (<em>schaeferi</em>) and 250,000-300,000 (<em>pamirensis</em>), thus totalling 400,000-480,000. In the absence of more precise data, these values are accepted here, noting that for the East Asian-Australasian Flyway alone, Hansen <em>et al.</em> (2022) also generated a figure in the hundreds of thousands (even accounting for the fact their estimate included <em>C. mongolus</em> too) and in the West–Central Asian Flyway, there must be an additional 6-figure population, given more than 120,000 birds were observed wintering at Barr al Hikman, Oman, alone in December 2016 (de Fouw <em>et al</em>. 2017).",
        "habitats": "<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory, with three definable groups migrating on a broad front to different wintering grounds spread from eastern and southern Africa through to coastal South-East Asia (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Bakewell 2022). Birds typically arrive in India, south Arabia and East Africa in early-August to mid-September (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). Some birds do linger at wintering or migration sites all months of the year if not breeding (Bakewell 2022, eBird 2023). <strong><br/>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season this species mainly occurs above the tree-line on mountains at altitudes of up to 5,500 m in the Himalaya&#160;<strong></strong>(Ladakh, Sikkim, and Tibet) (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). It inhabits barren valleys and basins in elevated tundra and mountain steppe, mainly near water (bogs) on moist but well-drained gravelly, rocky or sandy surfaces with sparse vegetation such as salt-pans, patches of detritus, dry edges of salt-marshes and places used by herds of cattle (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> The species is almost strictly coastal during the non-breeding season, preferring sandy beaches, mudflats of coastal bays and estuaries, sand-flats and dunes near the coast (Urban <em>et al. </em>1986, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). Very rarely the species also frequents coastal airfields (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996), and during migration it may be seen on the shores of inland lakes (e.g. the East African Great Lakes) (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Urban <em>et al. </em>1986) and rivers, or on cultivated land (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, Grimmett <em>et al.</em> 1998). <strong><br/>Diet </strong><em>Breeding</em> The breeding diet of this species includes many beetles, weevils, fly larvae, stalk worms and crabs (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).<em> Non-breeding</em> During the non-breeding season this species takes insects, crustaceans (such as crabs and amphipods), molluscs (particularly bivalves) and polycheate worms (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).<strong> <br/>Breeding site</strong> The nest of this species is a shallow scrape in bare sand or shingle (nesting pairs may often utilise cattle footprints), sometimes beside bushes and big stones (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).",
        "threats": "The threats driving declines in this species are very poorly known. For birds (<em>schaeferi) </em>that migrate through and winter on mudflats off eastern China, land reclamation was likely a significant threat to this species (and all East Asian-Australasian Flyway shorebirds); astonishingly, the extent of reclaimed land along the Yellow Sea coastline now exceeds the extent of remaining intertidal mudflat (IUCN 2023), suggesting that this may have contributed greatly to declines in this species. The rate of habitat lost to land reclamation has slowed since a peak in&#160;<em>c</em>. 2013, in particular in recent years due to the promised near-ceasing of land reclamation in China in early 2018 (Melville 2018). The impact of this on <em>C. atrifrons </em>directly however is not known, since no trend data for this taxon are available. Mudflats have also continued to degrade in suitability for this species and other shorebirds because of the invasive alien&#160;<em>Spartina alterniflora&#160;</em>cordgrass, which appears to be spreading; in recent (post 2020) years, this threat has probably driven greater declines than planned land reclamation.&#160;In addition to land reclamation, coastal development and a rapid increase in the human population along the coastline of the Yellow Sea has led to widespread degradation of mudflats and coastal habitats used by this species; IUCN (2023) (and references therein) cite the follows as additional drivers of mudflat loss and degradation: 'processes such as changes in sediment supply, loss of coastal vegetation associated with development...erosion, redistribution of sediments due to storms, and compaction and subsidence (sinking) caused by subsurface resource and groundwater extraction are also likely to be factors'. Although these threats are explicitly identified only for Yellow Sea mudflats, many of them (especially coastal development) will likely be impacting this species throughout its wintering range. Disturbance on mudflats by fishermen and others using the mudflats may also be reasonably considered a threat through its range. Hunting is also possibly a significant threat impacting this species, especially in South-East Asia (e.g., Gallo-Cajiao&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020, Yong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2022) but perhaps also in Africa, where this threat is not well studied. As a high-altitude breeding species, climate change may impact (or be impacting) this species, although this is entirely speculative. The extent to which each of these threats is driving declines (especially of <em>atrifrons</em>) is unknown.",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong>The main conservation actions currently being implemented to the benefit this species are on its migration route and wintering grounds in South-East Asia. China is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to clear tidal mudflats of&#160;<em>Spartina&#160;</em>cordgrass, with the aim of eliminating 90% of it by 2025; locally, this has already been successful, for example at Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve (Stokstad 2023). Although data on scale or impact are sparse, IUCN (2023) consider that \"support for coastal wetland conservation and wise-use appears to have increased over the last decade. There has been a substantial increase in the number of volunteer groups and NGOs helping to monitor the migrations of shorebirds and other waterbirds, as well as increased media coverage and special events, demonstrating enhanced awareness among coastal communities (see also EAAFP 2016).<br/>In 2021, the 'Regional Flyway Initiative' (RFI) was set up by the Asian Development Bank, with technical support from BirdLife International, with the aim of protecting and restoring priority wetland ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide in the East-Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), the most threatened flyway globally. The Initiative is slated for implementation in 10 East, South and Southeast Asian countries:&#160; Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, all of which are used (to varying extent) by&#160;<em>C. atrifrons</em>. The RFI will mobilise large-scale financing to support the protection, sustainable management and restoration of at least 50 priority wetlands across ten Asian countries, with an initial financing commitment of $3 billion from the ADB (BirdLife International 2022). Over time, the RFI aims to enhance and expand the existing efforts in conserving and managing priority wetlands identified on the basis of supporting globally significant congregations of migratory waterbirds, and&#160; leverage on collaborative opportunities with stakeholders including national governments, civil society organizations, communities, regional organisations like the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The main action needed for this species and other shorebirds is the amelioration of threats on its migration, which are currently thought to be the principal cause of its decline. Programmes such as China's plan to eliminate 90+% of&#160;<em>Spartina&#160;</em>cordgrass need to be implemented. The discharge of toxic pollutants into coastal wetlands (especially where there are large shorebird congregations) needs to be controlled across its non-breeding range. Further degradation of mudflats needs to be stopped, including monitoring and preventing detrimental release of riverine sediments. Perhaps the greatest research gap is on the species' breeding grounds. It is unclear what threats are faced by the species while breeding (particularly whether breeding productivity is decreasing in the face of climate change and increased predation etc.). Better understand which threats are contributing to the species' decline. The trend of all three subspecies (but especially <em>schaeferi</em>) is poorly known and rates of declines are currently suspected using data from only small parts of each taxon's range; monitoring throughout is therefore needed.",
        "use_trade": "Trapped on migration, especially for this species in China and the Philippines (reviewed by Gallo-Cajiao&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020, Yong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2022). The scale and extent of this threat elsewhere, especially on wintering areas in Africa, is unknown, but some offtake may be reasonably expected.",
        "rationale": "This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population trend is not known, but the population is not believed to be decreasing sufficiently rapidly to approach the thresholds under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.",
        "trend_justification": "There are few data available from which to generate trend data for this species, although available data suggest different populations are undergoing different trends. Subspecies <em>pamirensis </em>(&gt;50% of the global population) is believed to have a stable—or possibly slightly increasing—population trend (de Fouw <em>et al.</em> 2017, Nagy and Langendoen 2020). Subspecies&#160;<em>atrifrons&#160;</em>is evidently decreasing, perhaps rapidly, reflecting a broader trend for shorebirds in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway EAAF) to be declining at a faster rate than elsewhere. Evidence for&#160;<em>atrifrons&#160;</em>declines comes from India, where compiled eBird data suggest ongoing declines (State of India's Birds Partnership&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2023) and from several sites in Myanmar where rapid declines have been reported (C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2023). The trend in <em>schaeferi </em>is unknown, but this populations makes up a relatively small percentage of the global population. Evaluating these data together, if <em>pamirensis</em>&#160;and <em>schaeferi </em>are&#160;stable and <em>atrifrons&#160;</em>is declining at a rate of <em>c</em>. 30–50% over the past three generations, then accounting for relative population sizes, global declines over the past three generations (13 years: 2010–2023) have plausibly been in the 10–19% band. Future rates of decline are highly uncertain but may slow if the relative proportion of <em>atrifrons </em>in the global population decreases and planned conservation action on the species' flyway is successful. Accordingly, future rates of decline over three generations (13 years: 2023–2036) are placed in the band 1–19%. The drivers of these declines are not well known or understood. While <em>schaeferi </em>is assumed to be impacted by land reclamation and the invasion of <em>Spartina </em>cord grass (see Threats), the threats causing rapid declines in <em>atrifrons </em>are not well studied or understood.",
        "taxonomic_notes": "<em>Charadrius mongolus</em> and <em>C. atrifrons</em> were previously lumped as <em>C. mongolus</em> (Handbook of the Birds of the World and BirdLife International 2022), but <em>C. atrifrons</em> has been split on the basis of plumage (in breeding plumage, <em>mongolus</em> has white forehead (with narrow black dividing line) and very narrow black line dividing white throat from peach-coloured breast, whereas <em>atrifrons</em> has black forehead and no black line between throat and breast), vocal differences and deep genetic divergence (Livezey 2010, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2022). Three subspecies recognised."

        "range": "<em>Touit surdus</em> occurs in north-east <strong>Brazil</strong> (Paraíba, Pernambuco, Alagoas and Sergipe), and in the south-east from Bahia south to Rio de Janeiro. Recent surveys have found it to be one of the commonest forest parrots in the Atlantic Forest of Alagoas and in Murici Ecological Station (J. Mazar Barnett <em>in litt. </em>2002, H. Vilela and A. Andrade <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species was found in 16 out of 31 surveyed areas in southern Bahia, and at several sites in Pernambuco, Paraíba and Alagoas (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2014).<p></p>",
        "population": "The species is generally rare. The distribution range is well surveyed (see eBird 2023), and based on field reports the population is estimated with certainty to number less than 10,000 mature individuals, with less than 1,000 mature individuals in each subpopulation.<br/> The population in Murici Ecological Station is estimated at 50-100 individuals, and at other sites mostly only small groups of up to 15 individuals are recorded (H. Vilela and A. Andrade <em>in litt</em>. 2020).",
        "habitats": "It inhabits evergreen forest in lowlands and adjacent lower montane slopes, including mature secondary growth and plantations<strong> </strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). It is often found in flocks; in Murici flocks of up to 15 individuals are observed (H. Vilela and A. Andrade <em>in litt</em>. 2020). <br/>Groups have been observed moving between distant forest fragments, even crossing urban areas during dispersal<strong> </strong>(A. Whittaker <em>in litt</em>. 1999, G. Pereira <em>per </em>S. Dantas <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Reported foods are fruit of <em>Spondias lutea</em> and <em>Rapanea schwackeana</em>. At least in Rio de Janeiro, it may undertake seasonal movements.<p></p>",
        "threats": "Extensive deforestation throughout its range is regarded as the principal cause of its rarity, and the north-east population is most threatened because sugarcane plantations have replaced virtually all lowland forest in Alagoas<strong> </strong>(Brown and Brown 1992, Conservation International <em>et al.</em> 1995). Only 12% of Atlantic Forest remains in the Pernambuco Centre of Endemism. Further south in Bahia, less than 10% of forest is intact, and in the rest of its range suitable habitat has been reduced to less than 20% of its original extent (Conservation International <em>et al.</em> 1995). Lowland forests were historically threatened by agricultural conversion and deforestation for mining and plantations (Fearnside 1996). Current key threats arise from urbanisation and agricultural expansion<strong> </strong>(Dinerstein <em>et al.</em> 1995, ICMBio 2018). The species is not sought-after as a cagebird, and while there may be some trapping going on its impacts are considered negligible (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2014, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><p></p>",

        "use_trade": "There may be some pressure from trapping and trade, albeit only very low (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2014, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020).",
        "rationale": "This species is listed as Vulnerable because its population is small and declining owing to ongoing deforestation.<br/><p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "Declines are reported, likely as a consequence of habitat loss and degradation (ICMBio 2018). The species has become locally extinct in São Paulo and Ceará (ICMBio 2018, H. Vilela and A. Andrade <em>in litt.</em> 2020). Nevertheless, some populations, e.g. in the Pedra D'Antas Private Nature Reserve, have remained stable over the last 15 years (H. Vilela and A. Andrade <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<br/>Given that trapping pressure appears negligible in this species, population declines are assumed to be predominantly caused by habitat conversion. Despite its ability to cross areas of open habitat it requires continuous forests of at least 50-100 ha in size (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2014, G. Pereira <em>per </em>S. Dantas <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Tree cover within the range is lost at a rate of 6% over three generations (10.8 years; Global Forest Watch 2022, using Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). This value however does not account for the additional impacts of forest degradation and fragmentation, and therefore the overall rates of habitat loss, and consequently population decline, may be larger. Tentatively, population declines are here placed in the band 10-19% over three generations.",

While the nominate subspecies <em>dextralis </em>occurs between Rio Tapajós and Rio Xingu, subspecies <em>interjecta </em>is found further east between Rio Xingu and Rio Tocantins. Major rivers appear to form a hard barrier at the edge of the species' range, and this species is replaced by <em>P. viridis </em>to the west of the Tapajós and <em>P. obscura </em>to the east of the Tocantins (Oppenheimer and Silveira 2009, see also Santorelli <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2018).",
        "population": "The global population size has not been quantified, but this species is described as uncommon to rare (Stotz <em>et al.</em> 1996, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2022).",
        "habitats": "This is a species of dense lowland moist rainforest. It is highly  sensitive to forest fragmentation and anthropogenic disturbance, only  occurring in large tracts of mature forest away from human settlement  (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2022). It has a diverse diet, including fruit, arthropods, small vertebrates and carrion (Sherman 1996).",
        "threats": "<p>The primary threat to this species is accelerating deforestation in the  Amazon basin as land is cleared for cattle ranching and soy production,  facilitated by expansion of the road network (Soares-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bird <em>et al.</em>  2011). It is also suffering from hunting pressure and by now largely  restricted to undisturbed areas of mature forests away from human  settlements (Sherman 1996, A. Lees <em>in litt.</em> 2020, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2022).</p>",
        "measures": "<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong>The species occurs in several protected areas across its range, including Jamaxim, Serra do Pardo and Juruena national parks. The two subspecies are both listed as Vulnerable at the national level (ICMBio 2018).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Accurately quantify the population size. Quantify the impact of threats,  including habitat loss and hunting, on the population size. Monitor the  population trend. Monitor rates of habitat loss.<br/>Expand the  protected area network to effectively protect key sites. Effectively  manage protected areas, utilising emerging opportunities to finance  protected area management  with the joint aims of reducing carbon  emissions and maximizing  biodiversity conservation. Consider habitat  restoration and the creation of dispersal corridors. Raise awareness for  the species with the aim of reducing deforestation and hunting  pressure. Introduce legislation to regulate hunting. Incentivise  conservation on private lands through  expanding market pressures for  sound land management and preventing  forest clearance on lands  unsuitable for agriculture (Soares-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>",
        "use_trade": "The species is hunted for food (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2022).",
        "rationale": "<p>As a consequence of accelerating rates of habitat loss in combination  with the species' vulnerability to hunting it is suspected that the  population is undergoing very rapid declines, and it is therefore classified  as Endangered.</p>",
        "trend_justification": "The species is reportedly declining, as a consequence of habitat loss  and fragmentation in combination with hunting for food, and is now  restricted to remote areas far away from human settlements and  disturbance (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2022).<br/>Over the past three  generations (22 years), 21% of tree cover has been lost within the  range; since 2017 this has been increasing to a rate equivalent to 29%  over three generations (Global Forest Watch 2023, using Hansen<em> et al</em>.  [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). This species is described  as extremely sensitive to forest fragmentation, edge-effects and  anthropogenic disturbance (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2022).  Precautionarily it is therefore suspected that overall habitat loss  exceeds the rate of tree cover loss by half, suggesting an overall rate  of habitat loss of 31-32% over the past three generations and  accelerating to 44% over three generations from 2017 onward.<br/>The impact of hunting on the population size has not been quantified, but the species is described as susceptible (A. Lees <em>in litt</em>. 2020, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>.  2022). In the absence of a quantification of the impact it is  tentatively suspected that hunting contributes an additional c.5-10% to the  rate of population decline, accounting for the fact that the increase in logging activities in turn increases the accessibility to remote areas occupied by the species (per A. Lees <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Tentatively, past declines are therefore here placed in the  band 35-40% over three generations, with the rate accelerating to 50-59%  from 2017 onward.",

It also occurs in the Greater Sundas: Borneo, Sumatra and Java. It is possibly now extinct in southern China.<br/><p></p>",
        "population": "A total population of 5,000 individuals was previously estimated by Hancock (1992), Choudhury (2000) and BirdLife International (2001). However, more extensive survey effort in recent years has led to the upward revision of some national totals. Uncertainty is presented by the ratio of birds:mature individuals, with sub-adult non-breeders accounting for a significant percentage of numbers at some sites. In the Indian Subcontinent, the total number of breeding pairs is broadly unknown, but previous estimates of 1,200 mature individuals in India are likely to have underestimated its abundance. Across the Subcontinent in total (mostly India and Nepal), the number of mature individuals is suspected to lie between 2,000 and 5,000, although even these figures may prove underestimates with, for example, a recent survey in Nepal finding 109 nesting colonies (at least 346 nests) across 18 districts (Katuwal <em>et al</em>. 2023). In Myanmar, populations in the south have recently declined, with no more than 250-400 suspected nearly a decade ago (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014), with a figure between 100-400 estimated here. In Continental South-East Asia, the vast majority of the population is hosted in Cambodia, with small numbers (&lt;50 pairs) in Thailand, and perhaps <em>c</em>. 300 in Malaysia. In Cambodia, Goes (2013) estimated as many as 1,500 breeding pairs. Since these estimates were made, the population at Tonle Sap has increased (to&#160;<em>c</em>. 500 breeding pairs in 2021: Timmins <em>et al</em>. in prep.) while populations in the north have evidently continued to decline (S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2023). The total number of mature individuals in Cambodia is here set to 1,000-2,500. In Malaysia, a population of <em>c</em>. 300 has previously been suggested (BirdLife International 2001). On Sumatra, the population is very poorly known, but is likely now smaller than the <em>c</em>. 2000 individuals estimated in 1993. On Borneo and Java, no estimations of population size have been made, although the former still contains enough habitat to potentially saw multiple thousands of birds. Combining these data and the uncertainty surrounding them, the global population is estimated to be at least 5,000 mature individuals, but could number as many as 15,000. It is noted that the <em>total </em>number of birds is likely much greater than this, when sub-adult birds are included too.",
        "habitats": "Inland, birds inhabit natural and human-modified wetlands, both open and forested. Coastal populations frequent mangroves and intertidal flats. It nests colonially in large trees, and historically on cliffs, often at traditional sites in or adjacent to wetlands. It utilises small wetlands within Asian dry forest, and can breed some distance from these; shrinking of pools during the dry season and limited availability can lead to overlap with human uses and resulting disturbance. <p></p>",
        "threats": "Historic threats for this species are reviewed by BirdLife International (2001: 253–261), many of which (at least locally) still apply. The following were then identified as the principal causes of the rapid declines observed in the 20th century: (1) habitat loss and modification; (2) hunting and persecution; (3) pollution; (4) disturbance; and (5) invasive species. The first of these is probably the most critical threat still acting. Habitat loss and degradation in northern Cambodia between 2009 and 2017 (mostly post-2014), reduced the number of nesting Lesser Adjutants in the Northern Plains forests by 60% (from &gt;250 nests to &lt;100). In the Greater Sundas, especially Sumatra and the possible South-East Asian stronghold of Borneo, the industrial scale of lowland deforestation for oil-palm and rubber plantations (Global Forest Watch 2023) has undoubtedly caused declines over the past three generations, and some ongoing declines are suspected. The last of these, invasive species, was proposed as a threat because of speculation that an introduced population of&#160;<em>Mycteria leucephala </em>might compete with birds in western Peninsular Malaysia, but birds co-exist here and there is little evidence that this threat has become realised; it is therefore not considered here.<br/><br/>Locally, clearance of trees for agriculture and urban expansion occurs throughout this species' range. In continental South-East Asia, where the largest colony (by far) is Prek Toal, at the Tonle Sap Great Lake, long-term disruption to the Mekong–Tonle Sap flood regime is an ongoing threat to the future of this colony (see, e.g., Arias&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Morovati&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2023, and references therein), as is avian influenza (a threat that should be considered serious throughout its range) and fires (as occurred in 2016). Persecution and hunting has been greatly reduced over the past three decades; in particular the Prek Toal colony is now protected and in India the hunting of large waterbirds is now only a very localised, small-scale threat. Nonetheless, in some former breeding range states, especially Lao PDR, this threat remains probably the greatest obstacle to recolonisation (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press). A recent and potentially serious threat, recorded in Nepal and Cambodia, is the practice of poisoning pools to catch fish, which leads to incidental mortality of this species&#160;<strong></strong>(Gyawali 2004, S. Browne&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2005).<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Important nesting colonies are found in several protected areas in India and Nepal. In Cambodia, population increases have been achieved at the Prek Toal colony (in the Tonle Sap Great Lake RAMSAR site) by the protection of breeding birds at Prek Toal, with the species no longer breeding anywhere else in South-East Asia. This scheme has achieved success by employing round-the-clock monitoring provided by a team of rangers—including former poachers and egg robbers—to increase breeding productivity; this work has been supported logistically and technically by WCS. Elsewhere in parts of Cambodia financial incentives have been offered to local residents for the protection of nests, resulting in much higher rates of nesting success<strong>&#160;</strong>(T. Evans <em>in litt</em>. 2006; Clements<em> et al.</em> 2013); although overall away from Prek Toal the population continues to decrease. In the Greater Sundas, forest cover loss has slowed since 2020, especially in Kalimantan's peatswamp forests, principally because of an expanding and increasingly effective protected area network.<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Throughout its range, the principal needed conservation action for Lesser Adjutant is the protection of breeding colonies. In the Greater Sundas, this requires the protection of remaining lowland forests and ensuring that protected areas are adequately protected and financed.&#160;In South-East Asia, the greatest risk to this species is provided by the fact that the largest breeding population is now at Prek Toal, a site that continues to be subject to numerous threats (e.g. Morovati&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2023). In addition to mitigating these (particularly preventing further damage to the broader Tonle Sap landscape), safeguarding remaining populations in the Northern Plains, and establishing and protecting breeding populations elsewhere, should be considered a priority.&#160;A species action/recovery plan should be developed to best evaluate the ideas discussed here to enable this species to inhabit a greater percentage of its former range.&#160;In neighbouring Lao PDR, where this species was once presumably widespread through the country's lowlands (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999), there is suitable habitat for breeding and foraging birds, with hunting probably the only obstacle to recolonisation (Timmins&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>in press). In Thailand, wetland bird populations have (partially) recovered in the past twenty years (P. Round pers. comm.) but Lesser Adjutant remains a very rare breeding species that is absent from most of its former breeding range; this country should also be considered a priority for population and range expansion over the next decade. Here, hunting is a less pervasive problem than Lao PDR and may therefore prove itself a more realistic and immediate possibility. Identifying sites and means of attracting birds to breed should be undertaken; sites close to the Cambodian border should be prioritised to facilitate natural recolonisation. Throughout the Indian Subcontinent, protecting colonies in protected areas and using community-led initiatives is the priority (see equivalent text for <em>Leptoptilos dubius</em>). Of particular concern is that the species' predilection for using large trees in agricultural landscapes means that they are currently poorly represented in the protected area network (e.g., in Nepal: Katuwal <em>et al</em>. 2023). The conservation status of this species remains precarious and its current Near Threatened status relies on the continued generating of good data: robust monitoring must therefore also continue. Remote sensing data (e.g. Global Forest Watch 2023) should also continue to be used to monitor trends in forest cover in its range.<p></p>",
        "use_trade": "In the 20th century this species was commonly hunted for food and persecuted throughout much of its range (reviewed in full by BirdLife International 2001: 257–261). More recently, hunting pressure has been greatly controlled, but no doubt still happens in parts of its range. For example, this threat is probably the main one preventing recolonisation of Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press). Persecution in India may still occur locally, but has been greatly reduced.",
        "rationale": "This stork species has a broad distribution that spans much of South and South-East Asia (including the Greater Sundas) and remains in places locally common, including in highly modified agricultural landscapes. In the 20th century, numbers declined dramatically, leaving large parts of its former range (e.g. much of Indochina) unoccupied. The principal drivers of these declines were habitat loss and modification, and hunting/persecution. Thanks in large part to conservation measures, particularly the use of community-schemes to protect nesting birds, and an increasingly effective protected area network, recent (post 2000) rates of decline are thought to have slowed, although it is unclear what the current global population trend is. Although it is no longer at high risk of extinction, some populations are undoubtedly still declining, and the species remains vulnerable to threats. Accordingly, it is listed as Near Threatened.<br/><p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "This species' population is known to have declined rapidly over the past 100 years, in line with increasing levels of felling of colony nest trees, drainage and conversion of wetland feeding areas, agricultural intensification, pesticide use, disturbance and large-scale development in coastal areas, and, in some places most seriously, the persistent and unregulated harvesting of eggs and chicks from colonies. Confounding the elucidation of these trends, however, is a paucity of research from some regions, including those that may now host the most globally significant numbers.<br/>For assessment against Criterion A2, the trend of this species must be considered over the past three generations (41 years: 1982-2023). A discussion for each part of the species' range over this time period follows, broadly from west to east/north to south:<br/><br/>Undoubtedly the species' trend is most favourable in the Indian Subcontinent, where it remains locally common and relatively widespread in open agricultural, as well as forested, landscapes. Few robust data exist but comparing descriptive accounts of abundance and distribution in BirdLife International (2001) with recent citizen science data (eBird 2023) finds little evidence for noticeable declines in number or range extent. Nonetheless, in parts of Assam some breeding colonies have been lost (A. Choudhury <em>in litt</em>. 2023).<br/>The situation in Sri Lanka is poorly known, although nationally it was recently listed as Endangered B2ab(iii) suggesting evidence for a decline in suitable habitat but not necessarily mature individuals (Ministry of Environment, Sri Lanka 2021). In Nepal, in at least some protected areas the number of breeding individuals appears to be stable (e.g. Chitwan National Park: Poudyal and Nepal 2010, Bhattarai <em>et al</em>. 2021), although success rates are influenced, at least locally, by habitat availability in any given year/at any given site (Sundar <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019).&#160;Other populations in Nepal appear to have declined. For example the country's east, Karki and Thapa (2013) reported a decline at Urlabari Forest Grove from 62 adult birds in 2004 (Baral 2005) to 40 in 2013 (Karki and Thapa 2013). Because this is a long-lived species, it is possible that even in areas of its range where its trend appears stable, there are extinction debt effects associated with breeding success that is so far going undetected—this should be closely monitored. Similarly, there is evidence for contracting wetland and breeding habitat extent (Karki and Thapa 2013), with the protection of these considered critical for persistence (Katuwal <em>et al</em>. 2022).<br/><br/>Rapid declines in Bangladesh and Myanmar are largely thought to have predated the time window under consideration here, with populations evidently much-depleted by the 1980s, despite the species having once been common in both countries (BirdLife International 2001). A resident population is likely breeding in the Sundarbans (Chowdhury 2020) and a colony was relatively recently discovered in northern Bangladesh (Chowdhury and Sourav 2012) although these populations combined are probably small and are unlikely to be contributing greatly to the species' global trend. In Myanmar, recent records are from only the northern part of the country and notwithstanding the preceding comments, a recent decline along the Ayeyarwady is evident (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2020, C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2023).&#160;<br/>Elsewhere in continental South-East Asia, the population trend of this species is characterised by a steep decline to at least the 1990s (Wells 1999, BirdLife International 2001), followed by a recent resurgence in some areas driven wholly by the protection of Tonle Sap breeding colonies. In Thailand, it has almost disappeared, although this comment was also true more than two decades previously (BirdLife International 2001). Small numbers persist in Phang-Nga on Koh Phra Tong Island (<em>c</em>.30 pairs: K. Webb <em>in litt</em>. 2018)&#160;and wanderers from neighbouring Cambodia may be expected to increase in number over the next three generations. Almost identical comments are true of Lao PDR, where recent records are all assumed to refer to wanderers from Cambodia. At the latter, concerted conservation action since the early 2000s to protect the globally important breeding waterbird colonies at Tonle Sap has begun to reverse the precipitous declines of the last century. At Prek Toal, approximately <em>c</em>. 500 pairs bred in 2021 (Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press), representing a significant increase since, e.g., 2002, when only 71 pairs were breeding (Goes 2014). These increases, however, have been at least partially countered in Cambodia by declines outside of the Prek Toal population. Here, there is considerable uncertainty presented by the fact that birds are sparsely distributed through dry and semi-evergreen forest (S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2023) but between 2009 and 2017 (mostly post-2014), the number of nesting Lesser Adjutants in the Northern Plains forests declined by 60% (from &gt;250 nests to &lt;100), principally due to the loss of and disturbance to nesting habitat.<br/><br/>In the Sundaic region, few empirical data are available. Numbers in the Matang Mangrove Forest, Malaysia, remained relatively constant for 20 years to 2006&#160;<strong></strong>(Li&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007) and numbers over the past five years, at least, appear stable along the western coast of Malaysia (eBird 2023). Nonetheless, few colonies are known (J. Eaton pers. comm.), and the long-term viability of these populations is unknown. Alternatively, population trend data from Sumatra suggest a rapid reduction over the past three generations. Estimates in South Sumatra and Jambi provinces in 1984-1986 were 514 birds (388-620) and 272 (152-475) birds respectively, while surveys in these provinces in 2001-2004 estimated only 124 birds (30-318) and 7 birds (2-17) respectively (M. Iqbal&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2013). There is no indication of recovery over the past decade with numbers in both provinces evidently remaining low (eBird 2023). The species is thinly spread throughout the rest of Sumatra, with recent records throughout central and northern provinces only rarely consisting of more than 1-2 birds, with a slightly larger population probably persisting in Way Kambas (eBird 2023). Trend data from Borneo are almost non-existence, but the near-catastrophic removal of lowland forest over the past three generations (Global Forest Watch 2023) is assumed to have removed colonies from across the island which may, at one time, have hosted a significant portion of the global population.<br/><br/>Combining trends from across this species' global range is difficult owing to incomplete data, and great uncertainty about past population sizes and current trends. In South Asia, the population is broadly suspected to be stable or decreasing only very slowly. In continental South-East Asia, the population has certainly declined since the 1980s, but is now likely increasing despite local declines. In the Greater Sundas, the population is almost certainly still declining, potentially rapidly, in response to forest loss, predation and disturbance of nesting colonies. Combining these trends with approximations for population sizes in each region, the global population is suspected to have declined by 10-40% over the past three generations, with a best estimate lying somewhere between 15 and 29%. More empirical data, and ongoing monitoring of populations in South Asia, especially, are urgently sought however. The trend over the next three generations is unknown, but as long as conservation programmes continue to protect colonies in Cambodia, and in South Asia protected areas continue to refuge breeding colonies from disturbance, there is hope that the species' global population will remain stable or slowly increase. This may also be reflected by the re-colonisation of countries from which it has effectively been extirpated, including much of Thailand and Lao PDR.",

        "range": "This species has undergone a catastrophic range contraction since the 19th century, with extant breeding populations in only&#160;<strong>India</strong>&#160;and <strong>Cambodia</strong>. Historically, it had a distribution that spanned much of continental South and South-East Asia, from Pakistan (where it was a non-breeding, but regular, visitor), through much of India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR and Viet Nam, in all of which it, presumably, at one time bred, albeit with varying degrees of evidence to back up this assertion (BirdLife International 2001). From all of these latter named states, the species is now assumed extirpated, with any recent records almost certainly wanderers from elsewhere (giving rise to optimism about future colonisation if threats can be adequately mitigated). In India, all birds are now confined to Assam and Bisar (see Population Size justification). In Cambodia, it is now confined to only Prek Toal, having been extirpated from Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in 2013 due to forest clearance.",
        "population": "Although historically widespread across the South and South-East Asian subcontinents, <em>Leptoptilos dubius </em>is now confined to two isolated subpopulations: (1) in north-east India; and (2) in Cambodia.<br/><br/>In Assam, India, birds were accurately counted across eight known areas in 2022-2023, yielding a total of 380 breeding pairs (or <em>c</em>. 760 mature individuals) and a large non-breeding population of at least 1,070 birds (P. D. Barman <em>in litt</em>. 2023). This is equivalent to a total of 1,830 birds in the state, which is similar to an independent count of 1,950 birds made by Early Birds (an NGO in Assam) in the same year (P. D. Barman <em>in litt</em>. 2023). Outside of Assam, the only known breeding population in India lies in Bihar, where 600 birds were recently counted, comprising 100-125 active nests, or <em>c</em>. 200-250 mature individuals,&#160;between 2019 and 2021 (Choudhary and Abdullah 2023). Summing these data, the north-east India subpopulation is now considered to number at least 960-1,010 mature individuals, or 2,430-2,550 birds.<br/><br/>In Cambodia, recent (2020 and 2021) counts have been of 200-250 breeding pairs (400-500 mature individuals), or <em>c.</em>&#160;750 birds,&#160;at Prek Toal (R. Tizard <em>in litt</em>., Wetlands International 2021, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press), representing a marked increase on two decades ago. Overall, the global population is therefore estimated to be 1,360-1,510 mature individuals, or 3,180-3,300 birds.",
        "habitats": "While breeding in the dry season (October-April/May) it inhabits wetlands, nesting in tall trees with closed canopies and bamboo clumps around nesting trees, and historically on cliffs. Breeding is thought to coincide with the dry season in order to take advantage of abundant prey as water levels recede (Singha <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In north-east India, it occurs close to and within urban areas (A. Choudhury <em>in litt</em>. 2016), feeding around wetlands in the breeding season, and dispersing to scavenge at rubbish dumps, abattoirs and burial grounds at other times. In Cambodia, it breeds in freshwater flooded forest and areas of dry forest with ephemeral pools, otherwise dispersing to seasonally inundated forest, carcass dumps, tall wet grassland, mangroves and intertidal flats. It generally inhabits the lowlands but is occasionally found up to 1,500 m (Elliott and Kirwan 2020).<p></p>",
        "threats": "The chief cause of this species' catastrophic decline over the past 200 years has been the destruction and disturbance of its breeding and feeding sites. Hunting of adults and the collection of eggs and chicks have caused (rapid) declines in parts of the range also, and this threat would have likely been the proximate cause of extirpation in South-East Asia were the Prek Toal colony not protected through community engagement in the early 2000s. BirdLife International (2001) summarised the historic threats to this species as follows: (1) Habitat loss and modification caused by the drainage, degradation and pollution of wetlands used for foraging, as well as the clearance of breeding colonies for urban development and agricultural expansion; (2) Disturbance, particularly of breeding colonies, although this species is said to be somewhat tolerant of human disturbance; (3) Persecution, seen as a threat throughout much of its range, with birds historically hunted in India and sometimes killed because of locally held superstitious beliefs. In some former range states, especially Lao PDR this is probably the main cause of extirpation and greatly limits its recovery potential (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins <em>et al. </em>in press); (4) Lack of awareness of protective status and the rarity of the species; (5) Disease; and (6) Miscellaneous, including for example, the sporadic collision of this species with power lines. Whether the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, impacted this scavenging species in India, as it did vultures, is unknown.<br/>The recovery of this species in India and Cambodia has occurred solely through the amelioration of the most critical of these threats, and the species should continue to be regarded as wholly conservation dependent. Moreover, if the population is to continue to increase in abundance and range, then the amelioration and/or mitigation of these threats will be critical. Contemporarily, many threats remain for this species in current range states and beyond; while none of these are driving global declines (given the species' increasing population trend) they are in places likely preventing local and regional recovery. In India, the destruction of nesting trees does still occur in places (A. Choudhury <em>in litt</em>. 2023), mostly for urban and agricultural expansion, as does accidental poisoning on open rubbish dumps and the accidental ingestion of polythene bags (J. Mandal <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Persecution in India may still occur locally, but has been greatly reduced due to successful community engagement programmes. In South-East Asia, the entire population is now breeding at Prek Toal. Although this site has been subject to concerted and successful conservation action (virtually eliminating the threat of hunting), a number of threats do remain including avian influenza (a threat that should be considered serious throughout its range given the small number of colonies), fires (as occurred in 2016) and the long-term disruption of the Mekong-Tonle Sap flood regime (see, e.g., Arias <em>et al</em>. 2012, Morovati <em>et al</em>. 2023, and references therein). As recently as 2013, clearance of forest at Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in the Northern Plains of Cambodia caused this population to go extinct. Elsewhere in South-East Asia, hunting is probably preventing the recolonisation of Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press), while in Thailand (where modern persecution of large waterbirds is greatly reduced) recovery is possible and should be considered a conservation priority.",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Both subpopulations for this species are conservation dependent and the persistence of this species is therefore reliant on well-funded community-based conservation; if this ceases, the species is very likely to decline and its extinction risk will increase once more. In India, the community work of P. D. Barman is directly responsible for the change of fortunes in this species: The project was initiated in 2007 and combined community development, education and outreach; in particular, the work bestowed a pride and ownership for the storks by the villagers, including a (now large) group of rural woman named the '<em>Hargila </em>Army' who the project sought to empower to protect adjutant nests and help their economic livelihoods (see Barman <em>et al</em>. 2020 for more detailed summary). In particular, the project supported the sewing of traditional textiles, especially the <em>gamosa </em>(a traditional Assamese scarf) which are decorated with stork motifs and both sold and gifted to raise awareness. Critically, the project has deliberately avoided the use of direct economic payments to protect nests, but rather has relied (successfully) on providing economic opportunities for local people. The conservation program has also invested heavily in the education of children and students, reaching and educating 12,000 school children in its first 12 years (Barman <em>et al. </em>2020). This project has seen the population of nesting Greater Adjutants in Assam increase rapidly (Barman <em>et al</em>. 2020, P. Barman <em>in litt</em>. 2023); the next planned phase of the program is the 'Hargila Dream: 5,000 storks by 2030'. This phase aims to increase the number of Greater Adjutants in north-east India to 5,000 birds by 2030, but the success of this project will rely on appropriate resourcing and funding by donors, and support from policy makers. The continued recovery of this species in north-east India will likely rely on the success of this project.<br/>Similar successes have been achieved in Cambodia, where the protection on the Prek Toal colony (in the Tonle Sap Great Lake RAMSAR site) has caused the number of breeding birds to increase from fewer than 50 pairs in the early 2000s (BirdLife International 2001) to more than 200 breeding pairs in 2021 (Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press). This recovery has been driven by the protection of breeding birds at Prek Toal, with the species no longer breeding anywhere else in South-East Asia. This scheme has achieved success by employing round-the-clock monitoring provided by a team of rangers—including former poachers and egg robbers—to increase breeding productivity; this work has been supported logistically and technically by WCS.<br/><strong><br/>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/><span class=\"page_assessment_classScheme_content\"><span class=\"page_assessment_classScheme_content\">The most important conservation action for this species is ensuring that the currently operating conservation programmes in India and Cambodia are continued. Although this species is currently not considered at imminent risk of extinction, this status is dependent on conservation and will likely quickly deteriorate if these projects do not continue to be appropriately resourced. This species' population size is likely &lt;1% of what it was two centuries ago; its occupied range is probably an even lower percentage. Accordingly, there is the great potential for future recovery. In India, the 'Hargila Dream: 5,000 storks by 2030' project provides an achievable target with a proven track record of increasing adjutant populations; this should be prioritised and expanded in neighbouring areas. In South-East Asia, the greatest risk to this species is provided by the fact that the entire breeding population is now at Prek Toal, a site that continues to be subject to numerous threats (e.g. Morovati&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2023). In addition to mitigating these (particularly preventing further damage to the broader Tonle Sap landscape), establishing a breeding population elsewhere should be considered a priority.&#160;A species action/recovery plan should be developed to best evaluate the ideas discussed here to enable this species to inhabit a greater percentage of its former range.&#160;In neighbouring Lao PDR, where this species was once presumably widespread through the country's lowlands (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), there is suitable habitat for breeding and foraging birds, with hunting probably the only obstacle to recolonisation (Timmins <em>et al. </em>in press). Surveys to determine whether birds are already occasionally visiting southernmost Lao PDR are needed, as is effective community engagement and education so that the establishing of breeding colonies is possible. Sites near the Cambodian/Lao PDR border (for example,&#160;Dong Khanthung) should be prioritised. In Thailand, wetland bird populations have (partially) recovered in the past twenty years (P. Round pers. comm.) and this country should also be considered a priority for population and range expansion over the next decade. Here, hunting is a less pervasive problem than Lao PDR and may therefore prove itself a more realistic and immediate possibility. Identifying sites and means of attracting birds to breed should be undertaken; sites close to the Cambodian border should be prioritised to facilitate natural recolonisation. The conservation status of this species remains precarious and its current Near Threatened status relies on the continued generating of good data: robust monitoring must therefore also continue.</span>",

        "rationale": "This species was, at one time, considered Endangered because of rapid population declines, but since the early-to-mid-2000s, dedicated conservation action in its two remaining subpopulations (north-east India and Cambodia) has reversed this trend. The population trend is now increasing, and likely has been for more than ten years, meaning its immediate extinction risk is low. Nonetheless, the current global population is still only&#160;1,360-1,510 mature individuals, and Greater Adjutant is probably still entirely conservation dependent, such that any weakening of protection or reduction in conservation effort could lead to future declines once more; were this to occur, the species' moderately small population size renders it especially vulnerable. Accordingly it is currently listed as Near Threatened, but it is crucial that robust monitoring and effective conservation action continue to ensure that this species' recovery continues.&#160;<p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "Recent (post 2000) data indicate that both subpopulations (in north-east India, and Cambodia) are increasing. In north-east India, the population has increased to at least&#160;<em>c</em>. 1,800 in 2022–2023 (P. D. Barman <em>in litt</em>. 2023). In Cambodia, a colony of <em>c</em>. 20 breeding pairs (in 2004) in Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary was extirpated by 2013 (Harrison and Mao 2017), but this loss has been made up for numerically&#160;by increases at Prek Toal, where there are now more than 200 breeding pairs (Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press), up from <em>c. </em>150 pairs in 2013/2014 (Visal and Mahood 2015), and fewer than 50 pairs in the early 2000s (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2001, Wetlands International 2021). The increases observed in both countries stem entirely from conservation action in both subpopulations (e.g. Barman <em>et al</em>. 2020) and these look set to continue into the future, although widespread recoveries are likely to be constrained by the historic clearance of suitable habitat in its range (especially in South-East Asia), and remaining high hunting pressure in some countries (e.g. Lao PDR: Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press). Moreover, the Prek Toal colony is not considered wholly secure, with future possible threats including avian influenza, fire, development, and the long-term disruption of the Mekong–Tonle Sap flood regime (C. Poole <em>in litt</em>. 2023). Accordingly, while the population is on a trajectory to increase in the future, close monitoring is needed to ensure this is realised.<br/>Despite the successes documented, the population size of this species remains substantially depleted, with BirdLife International (2001) estimating then that the global population of the species likely represented 0.1-1% of the total in 1900—it has scarcely recovered these losses since, with the amelioration of threats highly localised, and the species occupying only a small percentage of the range it once did. The majority of these declines—driven chiefly by persecution and habitat modification—are suspected to have occurred in the first half of the 20th century (see Birdlife International&#160;2001 for summary), although there is limited evidence that the population in 2023 remains smaller than three generations ago (1985). For example, records from Rajasthan (India), Bangladesh and (with some uncertainty) Myanmar persisted until at least the 1990s (BirdLife International 2001), and in Thailand until the early 2000s (BirdLife International 2001, eBird 2023) since which there has been almost no repeat. [Nonetheless, with recoveries in Cambodia, sporadic future records in Thailand (and perhaps Lao PDR and Viet Nam) could be expected.] While there is therefore relatively high confidence that the species has declined since 1985, there is considerable uncertainty in determining the&#160;rate at which it has done so.<br/>Assuming conservation action continues to be successful in India and Cambodia (with parallel support in neighbouring states, e.g. in Thailand), population increases are projected to occur in the future, however it is unknown whether the causes of past declines are fully reversible; even if they are, full recovery is likely to take many decades.",

Although not formally known from <strong>Bhutan </strong>(Spierenburg 2005), it is here mapped as occurring there very narrowly, given some suitable habitat in the Himalayan foothills, and its occurrence in immediately adjacent India.<em><p></p></em>",
        "population": "The global population size has not been quantified, but the species has a large range, within which it is locally common (Madge and McGowan 2002, eBird 2023), such that its population size is unlikely to be especially small.",
        "habitats": "It inhabits dense undergrowth in broadleaved primary and secondary evergreen forest, and sometimes adjacent scrub, bamboo, grassland and cultivation, most frequently below 750 m in India, but usually at 610-1,220 m in neighbouring South-East Asia.  <p></p>",
        "threats": "It is principally threatened by habitat loss. Within its range, hill forests are diminishing slowly in extent and becoming fragmented because of shifting agriculture and logging, although this species is tolerant of habitat modifications, and this is thought to be causing only a slow rate of decline. Hunting and snaring of galliformes is presumably ongoing within its range, although much suitable habitat lies either in protected areas, or is very remote; this is therefore thought to be causing only negligible declines.<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>None specific to this species is known, although it occurs in a large number of protected areas throughout its range (Savini <em>et al</em>. 2021), within which it is evidently quite common (eBird 2023).<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to protect areas of suitable habitat. Where hunting is identified as an issue, implement strategies to engage local communities to minimise this pressure.<p></p>",
        "use_trade": "No empirical data, although the species is presumed to be hunted locally, especially in Myanmar.",
        "rationale": "This species has its stronghold in north-east India and adjacent Myanmar, throughout which it is thought to be declining because of habitat loss and degradation, and to a lesser extent, hunting. However, these declines are not thought to be rapid enough to meet or approach the thresholds for listing as threatened. Its population size has not been estimated but is suspected to be moderately large given the large extent of remaining suitable habitat. Moreover, a reasonable proportion of its range now lies in protected areas. Accordingly, its extinction risk is evaluated as being low and it is listed as Least Concern.<p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "The population is precautionarily suspected to be slowly declining in response to forest cover loss and localised hunting, although even when combined, these threats are not believed to have been rapid over the past three generations (13 years: 2010-2023). Remote sensing data (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein) indicate that forest cover loss in this species' mapped range was equivalent to 4-7% over the past three generations (depending on the assumptions used). This rate of loss is broadly similar to that reported in Savini <em>et al</em>. (2021), who calculated a reduction of forest extent of 7.5% between 2000 and 2018, equivalent to approximately 5.5% over three generations. However, these authors used a different range map to that used here, and set the species' elevational limits at 600-1,200 m (here it includes lowland forest, from which there are records, especially in India: eBird 2023). <br/>These calculations do not account for habitat degradation, although this species appears tolerant of habitat modifications, and even occurs in tea plantations, provided there is sufficient canopy cover. Consequently, habitat loss along is thought to have caused a reduction of 1-9% in population size over the past three generations. Hunting may be a localised threat (particularly in Myanmar, and away from protected areas), but this is unlikely to be driving substantial population declines. Considering both threats, the rate of population decline is set to 1-12% over the past three generations. There is no evidence to suggest that this rate will accelerate in the future, with an increasing percentage of the species' range now occurring in protected areas (Savini <em>et al</em>. 2021, UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2023). Given this species' tolerance of forest regrowth, declines are thought to be reversible.",

        "range": "This species has two somewhat widely disjunct populations. In the west, in <strong>India</strong>&#160;and <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, there is a resident population, with birds in northern west India apparently retreating south during the winter (see Mistri <em>et al</em>. 2017). There is also a resident population in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and through much of South-East Asia, including <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, north-east India, <strong>Myanmar</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong>, <strong>Lao PDR</strong>, <strong>Viet Nam</strong>, Hainan and Yunnan (<strong>China</strong>) and <strong>Cambodia</strong>. Many of these birds migrate south, then occurring in Peninsular <strong>Malaysia</strong>&#160;and Sumatra (<strong>Indonesia</strong>), where overlaps with resident <em>C. rufidorsa</em>. In the north of its range, some birds breed in the Himalayan foothills including, very narrowly, in <strong>Bhutan</strong>.",
        "population": "The global population has never been formally estimated but throughout its range descriptions of its abundance range from rare to locally common (Limparungpatthanakij and Hansasuta 2022). eBird (2023) data suggest that in South-East Asia it is rather thinly distributed (even accounting for inconsistent observer effort), although in some places this may be a reflection of recent declines rather than a natural scarcity.",
        "habitats": "In all seasons the species favours pools, creeks and streams in primary and mature secondary broadleaf evergreen forests (Limparungpatthanakij and Hansasuta 2022). On migration it is somewhat more adaptable, and then can occur in heavily degraded forests. Similarly, in non-breeding season it is evidently more catholic in habitat use than when breeding, and sometimes winters in wooded parks in urban areas.",
        "threats": "The threats driving declines in this species are somewhat enigmatic, at least in the extent to which each is driving declines. First, habitat loss and degradation are undoubtedly contributing to declines. In the past ten years, forest cover loss has been the equivalent of <em>c</em>.15% (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2013, Global Forest Watch 2023) and this is believed to be causing parallel declines in population size. The causes of these losses vary geographically. In South Asia and much of South-East Asia, losses have largely been driven by smallholder farming and agricultural expansion. In the wintering grounds of the Thai-Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, however, forest losses have largely been driven by industrial-sized plantations (particularly oil palm and rubber); to some extent, this has also locally occurred in South-East Asia. There is evidence that declines in this species exceed the gross rate of forest loss, although the exact drivers of this are not well understood. <br/>Collusion with windows on migration (Ali and Ripley 1983, Wells 1999, Round 2008, Low <em>et al</em>. 2017) may be a more acute threat than is currently realised, and there could be threat factors associated with migration (particularly the lack of suitable, connected habitat on passage) that are so far enigmatic. Notably, the fastest declining kingfisher species in South-East Asia, Black-capped Kingfisher <em>Halcyon pileata</em>, is also migratory (albeit with exceedingly different habitat needs and use).",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>No specific measures are known for this species, but it occurs in numerous protected areas throughout its range. Protected in India, Malaysia and Thailand (see Limparungpatthanakij and Hansasuta 2022).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Needed</strong><br/>The most important conservation action needed for this species is a better understanding of the threats driving its declines. In particular, the acuteness of the threat posed by buildings, and any other threat factors associated with migration, need investigation. Similarly, there is a need for monitoring at select sites (preferably a combination of strongholds and marginal sites) to help monitor population trends, since this species is currently suspected at declining at a rate faster than forest cover loss alone. Nonetheless, habitat trends should continue to be monitored using remote sensing data. Remaining lowland sites in the Greater Sundas merit immediate protection from further logging. Since this species can tolerate mature regenerated forest, schemes that protect degraded forests and aim to restore ecological function also provide an avenue for population recovery.",
        "use_trade": null,
        "rationale": "This species has a wide range throughout South-East Asia and, more locally, in South Asia. In response to a range of threats, not all of which are fully understood, it is suspected of having declined by 20-29% over the past ten years, a rate which approaches the thresholds for listing as threatened; accordingly, the species is listed as Near Threatened. The mechanisms behind these declines are enigmatic, but undoubtedly include habitat loss and degradation (driven by localised small-holder farming as well as industrial-scale plantations), and perhaps collisions with urban structures when migrating as well as other factors associated with migration that we are yet to elucidate. In the absence of evidence these threats are slowing in extent and intensity, the same rates of declines are suspected to occur in the next 10 years, but there is an urgent need for consistent monitoring and research to better unravel the causes of decline in this species.",
        "trend_justification": "The population is inferred to be declining in response to habitat loss and other threats (including collisions structures on migration) which have caused a decrease in population size over the past ten years. <br/>In the last 10 years (2013-2023), forest cover in this species' breeding/resident ranges declined by <em>c</em>.15% (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). This figure does not account for degradation, although <em>C. erithaca </em>is evidently capable of persisting in (sometimes highly) degraded habitats, but most losses in the 15% described amount to total clearance for agriculture, which will have a direct impact on this species. This species is apparently declining at a rate that exceeds forest cover loss alone, with reports of it having disappeared from sites it once formerly occupied (J. Eaton pers. comm. 2023). The mechanisms behind these additive declines, and the rate at which they're occurring, are poorly known. The species is among the most frequently reported species to collide with windows in Singapore (Low <em>et al</em>. 2017) and has been recorded colliding with structures nearly throughout its range (Ali and Ripley 1983, Wells 1999, Round 2008) although the contribution of this threat to suspected declines remains very poorly known. There may also be factors associated with migration that are impacting this species in ways that are not yet known. In particular, potential wintering strongholds of low-lying forest in Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra may have been converted to palm oil plantations, which this species does not appear able to tolerate. Nonetheless, this is highly speculative, and it is ultimately unknown what percentage of <em>C. erithaca </em>migrate this far south. Precautionarily, over the past ten years, it is suspected of having declined by 10-29%, with a best estimate at the midpoint, of 15-25%. These suspected rates require empirical confirmation but in the absence of clear amelioration of these threats going forward, are precautionarily suspected to occur in the future.",
        "taxonomic_notes": "<em>Ceyx erithaca</em> and <em>C. rufidorsa</em> (Handbook of the Birds of the World and BirdLife International 2023) were previously lumped as <em>C. erithaca</em> (del Hoyo and Collar 2014) despite being previously split following Sibley and Monroe (1990, 1993). Lim <em>et al. </em>(2010) make a convincing case for species-level genetic differentiation and suggest that intergrades have resulted from past introgression rather than ongoing gene flow. Confounding factors include the facts that <em>C. erithaca</em> is a partial migrant and that the Bornean population <em>motleyi </em>appears intermediate in plumage, but genetically belongs with <em>rufidorsa</em>. See C. rufidorsa for differences. Closely related to <em>C. rufidorsa</em>, <em>C. melanurus</em> and <em>C. mindanensis</em>; molecular data indicate that they form a well-supported clade with <em>C. lepidus</em>, <em>C. cyanopectus</em> and <em>C. argentatus</em> (and taxa previously included within those species) (Moyle <em>et al. </em>2007). Original specific name <em>erithaca </em>is a noun, and therefore remains unchanged, irrespective of gender of genus in which placed (David and Gosselin 2002). Two subspecies currently recognized.<p></p>"

It is currently only known from a very limited number of specimens and field observations, but may be locally common (Dutson 2011). The last documented record of this species is a specimen collected in 1979 (LACM 91065, per Rutt <em>et al.</em> in prep), though&#160;there have been a number of unconfirmed records since. It was not recorded by rapid surveys in 2014&#160;suggesting that the species is&#160;potentially very rare and restricted to higher altitude or localised areas&#160;(Aplin<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015).",
        "habitats": "Its ecology is poorly known, but the species is possibly restricted to closed forest in hills (Dutson 2011, Aplin<em> et al. </em>2015).",
        "threats": "Primary forest cover was severely reduced from the 1980s onwards as a result of commercial logging operations (Aplin <em>et al.</em> 2015). Although this slowed since 2000, remote sensing data indicate that forest loss is now accelerating again within this species' range (Global Forest Watch 2023, using data from Hansen <em>et al.</em> [2013] and methods disclosed therein).&#160;Feral pigs are a major pest species on the island but any impact on the species is unknown.",

Produce population and trend estimates. Study the basic ecological requirements of the species. Protect remaining areas of habitat.",

        "rationale": "This species has a highly restricted range on a single island. Knowledge of its population size and trend is very limited, but there is ongoing forest loss and degradation within the range and it is likely restricted to few locations. It is therefore assessed as Vulnerable.",
        "trend_justification": "There are no data on population trends, but extensive logging is continuing on the island (Taylor 2020). Although the species is poorly known, it is thought to be restricted to closed forest (Dutson 2011, Aplin<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2015) and is precautionarily suspected to be declining as a result. In the three generations to 2022, remote sensing data indicate that c.5% of forest was lost in this species' range (Global Forest Watch 2023, using data from Hansen <em>et al.</em> [2013] and methods disclosed therein). The rate of forest loss has rapidly accelerated in recent years however, reaching an equivalent rate of c.10% in three generations based on losses in 2017-2022. Based on even steeper losses in 2022 alone, forest loss may continue at a rate equivalent to c.20% within three generations if this is ongoing. Assuming declines are roughly equivalent to the rate of forest loss, they are tentatively placed in the range 1-9% in the past three generations, 1-15% between 2017 and 2027 and 1-19% over the future three generations.",

However, there had not been any records for some time prior to this, with reports of reed-warblers being present by D. Aldan and J. Sablan into at least the 1960s (Reichel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992) appearing to be the last observations. The primary threat is thought to have been severe habitat modification through wetland drainage for agriculture and grazing by feral livestock (Hume 2017). Predation by rats and cats is also thought to have driven declines (Hume 2017). The volcanic eruptions in 1981 appear to mark a full stop to the possibility of the species persisting, as all herbaceous and virtually all woody vegetation was destroyed in the last known site, around the upper lake (Reichel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1992).<p></p>",

Udin <em>in litt</em>. 2023).<br/><strong><br/>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct repeated surveys across the species' range to quantify its population size and status. Conduct ecological studies to improve understanding of its precise habitat requirements, tolerance of secondary habitats and response to fragmentation. Effectively protect significant areas of suitable forest at key sites, in both strictly protected areas and community-led multiple use areas.<br/><p></p>",

No direct data are available to estimate the rate of decline, however in the 11 years to 2022, forest cover in the species' range declined by <em>c</em>. 7% (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). Its exact habitat tolerances are poorly known, but it is at least somewhat forest dependent (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2020, J. S. Udin <em>in litt</em>. 2023) and rates of forest loss are considered a reasonable proxy for population reduction; accordingly it is suspected of declining at an ongoing rate of 5-15% over three generations.",

The population trend appears to be stable, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.",
        "trend_justification": "The population is suspected to be stable in the absence of evidence for any declines or substantial threats. While there is a low to moderate rate of forest cover loss across the range of the species, it uses forest edge, degraded forest, some plantations and large gardens and is unlikely to be severely affected by loss of intact forest, where it is less frequently observed.",
        "taxonomic_notes": "<em>Dicrurus ludwigii</em> and <em>D. sharpei</em> were previously lumped as <em>D. ludwigii</em> (Handbook of the Birds of the World and BirdLife International 2022) but split following Fuchs <em>et al. </em>(2017, 2018) and Fishpool <em>et al.</em> (2021). See under <em>D. sharpei</em>. The taxon <em>saturnus </em>was considered by Fuchs<em> et al. </em>(2017) to be better placed with <em>sharpei</em>, but this suggestion was later reversed (Fuchs <em>et al.</em> 2018). Proposed subspecies <em>elgonensis </em>included in <em>saturnus</em>; subspecies <em>tephrogaster </em>appears to be transitional, and may be better included in nominate. Four subspecies recognised."

        "range": "Blossom-headed Parakeet occurs in South and South-East Asia, ranging from <strong>Nepal </strong>(most recent records from Chitwan National Park: eBird 2023), east through the Himalayan foothills to north-east&#160;<strong>India</strong> and south to eastern<strong> Bangladesh</strong><strong></strong>, through most of&#160;<strong>Myanmar</strong>&#160;and neighbouring western Yunnan, <strong>China</strong>.&#160;It is widespread in&#160;<strong>Thailand </strong>(north of the peninsula) and <strong>Cambodia</strong>, but is highly localised in <strong>Lao PDR </strong>and <strong>Viet Nam</strong>, where now only known from sporadic records in the south of both countries. Similarly, there are no recent records from Guangxi and Guangdong provinces in southern China, despite historic occurrence there. Although the species is yet to have been entirely extirpated from any range state, the overall EOO is thought to have reduced from 3,870,000 km<sup>2</sup> three decades ago, to only 2,670,000 km<sup>2</sup> now. If the current threats continue, extinction in Lao PDR and Viet Nam are possible.<br/><br/>Given this species' use in the pet trade, it is perhaps unsurprising that this species occasionally escapes and turns up elsewhere. For example, there are several records from urban centres including Singapore and Hong Kong (eBird 2023) but it is not considered established here or anywhere else outside its native range. It is mostly sedentary, with some localised seasonal movements (presumably in response to food pressures).",
        "population": "The global population size has not been quantified, but the overall abundance appears to be much reduced across its range in recent decades (Collar and Kirwan 2017). In Lao PDR and Viet Nam, now very scarce (Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press., eBird 2023), but in India, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia it remains locally common (Goes 2013, Thin Thin Khaing and Khin Myint Mar 2019, eBird 2023).",
        "habitats": "This species occurs in the lowlands to c.1,500 m, inhabiting light forest, including savanna, secondary growth, forest edge, clearings and cultivated areas (Juniper and Parr 1998). It is particularly associated with dry deciduous forest throughout south-east Asia (Goes 2013, R. J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013); although it is occasionally observed in semi-evergreen forest, it seems to be dependent on drier habitat (Goes 2013, W. Duckworth <em>in litt. </em>2016). It is able to persist in partially deforested landscapes and appears to favour forest edge near cultivation (Juniper and Parr 1998). It breeds in January-May, nesting in tree cavities and laying a clutch of usually 4-5 eggs (Juniper and Parr 1998).",
        "threats": "Capture for the cagebird trade is the chief threat to this species throughout its range, having caused the near-extirpation of it from parts of its range (e.g. Lao PDR: Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press.). There are few empirical examples of the scale of this trade, although at a single site in Myanmar between December 2018 and April 2019,&#160;1,744 individuals were reported for sale from (Thin Thin Khaing 2019). It is also obscure what percentage of the trade in this species is international, although the appearance of birds in markets in Indonesia (not a range state) (Chng&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018) suggests that to some degree, birds are traded internationally. Although the species is listed in CITES Appendix II, there are very few trade records (CITES Trade Database 2023: all from Europe and likely refer to captively bred birds) suggesting that this mechanism is ineffective at monitoring trade currently. Habitat loss and degradation is considered a secondary threat. This species is very tolerant of habitat degradation and occurs, for example, in forest edge interspersed with cultivation (Juniper and Parr 1998). However, at least in South-East Asia, the species shows a strong affinity for lowland deciduous dipterocarp forests which have been subject to some of the most intensive habitat modifications in Indochina. Accordingly, habitat loss has locally likely contributed to some extent to declines; Timmins <em>et al</em>. (in press.) considered in Lao PDR that although habitat loss and degradation is unlikely to have been a proximate cause of population collapse, it \"could perhaps limit any future recovery if hunting is controlled\".",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservations Actions Underway<br/></strong>The species occurs in numerous protected areas in all range states (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2023). Listed in CITES Appendix II.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Because habitat loss and degradation are considered only secondary threats for this species, the most important threat to address is that of trapping. In particular, this species should be protected in all range states and those where it is must ensure legislation is upheld. There is an urgent need to better quantify the impact of trade on wild populations. Long-term, the most successful way to address trapping is with community engagement, in particular, the need for awareness-raising activities to discourage nest-robbing and trapping. Timmins <em>et al</em>. (in press.) noted that in Lao PDR, habitat degradation may now or soon be at a scale that limits recovery potential; accordingly, although this species <em>is </em>tolerant of fragmented and degraded forest landscapes, there is undoubtedly a need to robustly protect areas of dry deciduous forest for this and other species dependent on this biome. Rates of forest loss should continue to be monitored using remote sensing data.",
        "use_trade": "Capture for the cagebird trade is the chief threat to this species throughout its range, having caused the near-extirpation of it from parts of its range (e.g. Lao PDR: Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press.).

Although the species is listed in CITES Appendix II, there are very few trade records (CITES Trade Database 2023: all from Europe and likely refer to captively bred birds) suggesting that this mechanism is ineffective at monitoring trade currently.",
        "rationale": "This species has a wide range that spans most of continental South-East Asia and parts of the Indian Subcontinent. While its population is suspected of still being relatively large, trapping for the cagebird trade is ongoing at a scale thought to be driving moderately rapid declines: this is especially true in Indochina, where populations in Lao PDR and Viet Nam have declined very rapidly over the past three decades. In some range states (particularly India and Thailand) populations may be stable or declining only slowly. Habitat loss and degradation may be an additive threat to this species especially in South-East Asia where the species has a strong affinity to lowland deciduous dipterocarp forest. Evaluating its global status, the species is assessed as Near Threatened due to rates of population reduction suspected to approach the threatened thresholds. The impacts of trapping must be monitored closely, especially alongside evidence of population declines in range states where the species is currently considered comparatively secure.",
        "trend_justification": "Declining globally due to unsustainable levels of exploitation for the pet trade and, to a lesser extent, habitat modifications. Combined these have driven range contractions (especially in Indochina) and a general reduction in local abundance (almost everywhere). Trends are discussed briefly for each range state, broadly from west to east.<br/><br/>In India, Nepal and Bangladesh, probably more secure than in other range states (with a large percentage of birds now in protected areas), although some localised trapping does occur, including in protected areas (e.g. Gubbi and Linkie 2012), and it is possible that even here numbers are declining. In Myanmar, almost certainly declining. Birds are widely captured for the pet trade (e.g., between December 2018 and April 2019, 1,744 individuals were reported for sale from a single site in Magway: Thin Thin Khaing [2019]) and at some sites numbers are probably (perhaps greatly) depleted, although at others it remains common (Thin Thin Khaing and Khin Myint Mar 2019, eBird 2023). In Thailand, remains common at numerous localities (eBird 2023) and numbers here are likely stable or perhaps declining only very slowly in response to trapping, which even here is considered a localised threat (Sanguansombat 2005). However, it appears to have declined from southernmost Thailand (the southern limit of its global range), where it was formerly known (Robson 2002, eBird 2023).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, remains locally common and widespread (Goes 2013, eBird 2023) with little evidence of a rapid decline in the past three generations and its status providing 'little cause for concern' (Goes 2013). Nonetheless sightings have apparently declined at some sites since the 1990s (Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and it is plausibly declining slowly. In Lao PDR, occurred historically throughout plains-level dry forests, although by the 1990s it was already local and scarce (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999) and by 2022 had apparently declined substantially and is now very rare and local, with 'few reliable records in the 2000s'&#160;(Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press.). Although there are no published accounts or data, a similar, contemporaneous decline is suspected from Viet Nam, from which there are now only sporadic records (eBird 2023). In both countries, rapid declines have largely been driven by capture for the pet trade (see, e.g., Banjade <em>et al</em>. 2020), but the species' narrower ecological niche compared to other parakeets in Indochina perhaps also make it more vulnerable to habitat alteration (Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press) and the widespread loss of deciduous dipterocarp forest in both countries (Global Forest Watch 2023) has likely compounded declines (or is impeding recovery), despite this species' tolerance of forest degradation.<br/><br/>Evaluating trends into numeric rates of decline is very difficult, since in none of its range does robust population monitoring occur. However, over the past three generations (24 years: 1999–2023) it is plausible that global declines have exceeded 20%, owing to the collapse of populations in Indochina, offset to a considerable extent by relatively stable (or slow declining) populations elsewhere. Accordingly, over the past three generations, populations are suspected to have declined by 10–29%. The same rate of decline is suspected in the window 2005–2029, thus this species approaches thresholds for listing as threatened under Criteria A2 and A4. Rates of future decline are considerably more uncertain. An increasing percentage of the population now lies outside Indochina and is protected in effective protected areas, such that any future decline is likely to be less than that of the past. Alternatively, demand for the species in the pet trade may prove great enough to shift trapping pressures to other range states, causing similar declines in the future.",
        "taxonomic_notes": "<em>Himalayapsitta roseata&#160;</em>(Handbook of the Birds of the World and BirdLife International 2020) was previously listed as&#160;<em>Psittacula roseata&#160;</em>(del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).&#160;Braun&#160;<em>et al</em>.

        "range": "It is confined to the island of Wangi-wangi off south-east Sulawesi, <strong>Indonesia</strong>. It is, perhaps surprisingly, apparently absent from Wangi-wangi's close satellites of Oroho and Kapota (see O'Connell <em>et al</em>. 2020, Menner 2021).",
        "population": "Descriptively, this species is described as locally common (O'Connell <em>et al</em>. 2020, Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021), but in eBird checklists generated (eBird 2023), it is evidently rarer than <em>Z. flavissimus</em>, with almost no search effort finding more then five individuals (where counts of 20+ <em>Z. flavissimus </em>are not uncommon). Based on 16 transects across the island, a density of 0.2 birds/hectare, or 20 birds/km<sup>2</sup>, was recorded in 2012/13 (unpublished data: D. O'Connell, S. Kelly and Adi Karya pers. comm.). The area of suitable habitat across Wangi-wangi is <em>c</em>. 60-80 km<sup>2</sup>, suggesting that the island may host up to&#160;<em>c. </em>1,600 birds. However, there are numerous assumptions being made in this estimate which require consideration. First, all transects used to derive it were placed in secondary-type habitat, with qualitative reports (O'Connell <em>et al</em>. 2020, Menner 2023) that the species occurs at higher densities in the island's taller forests; because the area of taller forest is relatively small (<em>c</em>. 10 km<sup>2</sup>), it is suspected that even if birds here occur at a much higher density, the total population is unlikely to exceed 2,500 birds. Second, not all of the birds encountered will have been mature individuals. Third, data were collated 10 years ago, with evidence that the species may have been subject to trapping pressure and reduced in number since (see Population Trend). In the absence of data from which to derive robust minimum and maximum population bounds, it should be noted that the limits used here are somewhat arbitrary, albeit with relatively high confidence that they encapsulate all plausible scenarios. The total number of birds is estimated to number 800-2,500 birds, or 500-2,500 mature individuals, with a best estimate of 500-1,500 mature individuals.",
        "habitats": "It is confined to taller forest on Wangi-wangi than is <em>Z. flavissimus</em>, including agricultural areas where taller trees persist (Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021). O'Connell <em>et al</em>. (2020) report it to be associated with 'thick tangles, epiphytes and vines on emergent large trees'.",
        "threats": "The two critical threats to this species are habitat loss and degradation, and trapping for the Indonesian songbird trade. The former has been more extensive historically but continues at a slow rate, mostly as a result of localised timber extraction and the conversion of forest for tourism infrastructure. Trapping for the Indonesian songbird trade is plausibly the main threat to this species currently, with birds appearing in markets almost immediately after public attention to its existence was drawn. The scale of the trade is not currently well understood, nor is its impact on wild populations. However, the species is believed to be declining and given its small population size, and the history of Indonesian songbird trappers extirpating small-island taxa very quickly (Eaton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Collar and Wirth 2022), it is possible that this threat is, or becomes, very acute. The trade in this species is probably solely domestic, with most birds likely going to Java.",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong>The entire range is circumscribed by the Wakatobi National Park (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2023), although with ongoing trapping and forest cover loss, the level of protection this has so far conferred is unclear. More recently, an agreement between Prigen Conservation Breeding Ark (PCBA) (and KASI/Taman Safari) and Wakatobi National Park aims to strengthen protection for remnant habitat for <em>Z. paruhbesar </em>and (on other islands), the endemic taxon of <em>Cacatua sulphurea paulandrewi </em>(Menner 2021). This work has continued and in late 2023, PCBA were conducting the first comprehensive survey on the distribution, population status and ecology of the species (Menner 2023). Because of its recent formal description (Irham <em>et al</em>. 2023), <em>Z. paruhbesar</em> is not currently protected under any national or international legislation, although it is listed on 'Tier 1' (in immediate need of conservation action) by the <em>Asian Songbird Trade Specialist Group </em>(Collar and Wirth 2022). Following concern that trapping posed an imminent risk to this species, an insurance captive breeding population was established at PBCA where, as of August 2023, 23 birds were held (J. Menner <em>in litt</em>. 2023).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Continue to monitor habitat trends using remote sensing data. Investigate the feasibility of implementing reforestation programmes on Wangi-wangi to increase the area of suitable habitat. Continue captive breeding programmes (potentially at more than one facility) as an insurance against extirpation in the wild. Have the species protected under domestic Indonesian law and consider listing in CITES Appendices as a means to control and monitor trade in this species, which is likely the greatest future threat (although this threat is mostly for the domestic trade, such that it's unclear whether CITES listings will confer any meaningful protection).",
        "use_trade": "Trapping for the Indonesian songbird trade is plausibly the main threat to this species currently, with birds appearing in markets almost immediately after public attention to its existence was drawn. The scale of the trade is not currently well understood, nor is its impact on wild populations.

The trade in this species is probably solely domestic, with most birds likely going to Java.",
        "rationale": "This species—described to science as recently as 2022—is endemic to the tiny island of Wangi-wangi, Indonesia, where it has a small population (500-1,000 mature individuals), Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and Area of Occupancy (AOO). Trapping for the songbird trade appears to have made it scarcer since its initial discovery, and it is therefore believed to have a limited number of Locations and be undergoing a continuing decline in mature individuals. Moreover, habitat loss caused by timber extraction and the expansion of tourism infrastructure is removing suitable habitat. With evidence from elsewhere in Indonesia that trapping for the songbird trade can cause rapid declines in&#160;<em>Zosterops </em>species, this species' small range and population size render it especially vulnerable to extirpation in the wild. Accordingly, it is listed a Endangered.<em>&#160;</em>",
        "trend_justification": "The population is inferred to be declining because of two key threats: (1) habitat loss and degradation; and (2) trapping for the songbird trade. <br/>Over the past ten years (2012-2022), remote sensing data indicate that approximately 5% of forest cover on Wangi-wangi has been lost (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). This is thought to have some impact on the population size of this species, especially given many losses have been recorded in areas of more mature forest, where where this species is reportedly commonest (O' Connell <em>et al</em>. 2020; Menner 2021, 2023). However, there is also evidence that it persists in degraded habitats (O'Connell <em>et al</em>. 2020, eBird 2023, unpublished data: D. O'Connell, S. Kelly and Adi Karya pers. comm.) such that not all forest loss may directly impact the population size, although Menner (2023) regarded it 'dependent' on taller vegetation and 'sensitive to human habitat alteration'. Consequently habitat loss and degradation is suspected of causing some slow declines, with most impacts of this threat having been historical. <br/>The second, perhaps most serious, threat to this species (trapping) is considerably harder to quantify, especially in the absence of repeated survey effort. The species has already been recorded in the songbird trade (O' Connell <em>et al</em>. 2020, Asian Songbird Trade Specialist Group <em>in litt</em>. 2023) but the impact this is having on wild populations is currently improperly known. However, observations in O'Connell <em>et al</em>. (2020), from a decade ago, that it was readily found and mist-netted in degraded habitats were not repeated by Menner (2021), who found it only, after several days of effort (albeit not at typically an optimal time of day), in mature habitat. More recently, Menner (2023) continued to find it distributed 'throughout the island'. Acknowledging that trappers are capable of such pressure (as demonstrated elsewhere in Indonesia), and the anecdotal reports that the species has indeed declined over the past decade, it is accepted that the species is undergoing a continuing decline, although in the absence of repeated surveys, the rate of this decline is not currently estimated. Elucidating this should be considered an utmost research priority.",

        "range": "In the breeding season, the species is confined to <strong>Russia</strong>. It may also breed on Attu Island, Alaska, <strong>United States of America </strong>(eBird 2023)&#160;although this is unconfirmed and from here (and more widely along the Alaskan coastline, mostly through the Aleutian Island Chain) it is for now considered only a passage migrant. From its breeding grounds, birds undergo an epic trans-equatorial migration south, after which almost all birds winter in <strong>Australia</strong>, with inconsistent numbers wintering in <strong>New Zealand</strong>. It has been recorded, or is assumed to occur, in almost all nation states between. Its exact migration routes remain improperly understood, owing to confusion in non-breeding plumage with <em>C. atrifrons</em>, from which knowledge has only recently allowed separation. Using photographs available on eBird (2023), Bakewell (2022) elucidated that <em>C. mongolus </em>takes a principally eastern migration route having never, for example, been recorded in Thailand or Peninsular Malaysia. Birds move south, chiefly coastally, through Russia, <strong>Japan</strong>&#160;and the Korean Peninsula (<strong>Republic of Korea</strong>&#160;[South Korea] and <strong>Democratic People's Republic of Korea</strong>&#160;[North Korea]), <strong>China</strong>&#160;(including Taiwan), the <strong>Philippines</strong>, eastern Borneo (<strong>Malaysia </strong>and <strong>Indonesia</strong>, but no records from Brunei), the Indonesian Archipelago (east of Bali), <strong>Timor-Leste</strong>&#160;[East Timor] and <strong>Papua New Guinea</strong>. Birds frequently pass through many Pacific states, including <strong>Fiji</strong>, <strong>Guam</strong>, the <strong>Federated States of Micronesia</strong>, the <strong>Marshall Islands</strong>, <strong>Northern Mariana Islands</strong>, <strong>Palau</strong>,&#160;<strong>Vanuatu</strong>,&#160;<strong>Solomon Islands</strong>,&#160;<strong>Nauru </strong>and&#160;<strong>New Caledonia</strong>. On occasion, birds may winter in these areas, but for the most part they are only passage migrants, with birds wintering further south. The same states are visited on the return northbound migration.",
        "population": "Hansen <em>et al</em>. (2022) estimated that in 2016 there were approximately 180,000-275,000 ‘Lesser Sand Plovers’ in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, although this total includes populations of <em>C. atrifrons</em>, which are (substantially) more numerous. Rogers <em>et al.</em> (2021) estimated that in Australia (where the majority of this species winters), numbers of mature individuals of&#160;<em>mongolus </em>and <em>stegmanni </em>were, respectively, 8,000-13,000 (best estimate 9,000) and 10,000-17,000 (best estimate 12,000), thus suggesting a total population of 18,000-30,000 (best estimate 21,000). Direct count data in Australia (from which the estimates above were largely derived) found at least <em>c</em>.20,000 birds with an extrapolated estimate of <em>c</em>.40,000 but not all of these birds will have been mature individuals, thus the total population in Australia used here follows Rogers <em>et al</em>. (2021). While this is considered a majority of the global population, it is unclear how many birds winter in eastern Indonesia and New Guinea (D. Rogers <em>in litt</em>. 2023), thus the upper bound of any global population estimate is also highly uncertain. Accepting that the Australian population does represent a majority, the global population is suspected to number 18,000-50,000 mature individuals, although this is highly uncertain.",
        "habitats": "<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory, with two definable populations: <em>mongolus </em>and <em>stegmanni </em>both breed in Far Eastern Russia, migrating through the Korean Peninsula, Japan, China, the Greater Sundas and Lesser Sundas, mostly August-October, with birds then mostly wintering in Australia (and to an unknown extent in New Guinea and Wallacea).&#160;<strong><br/>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> In Siberia and the Commander (Komandorskiye) Islands the species breeds on mountains but also at sea-level, here inhabiting sand dunes and shingle along the coast (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> The species is almost strictly coastal during the non-breeding season, preferring sandy beaches, mudflats of coastal bays and estuaries, sand-flats and dunes near the coast (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996), occasionally frequenting mangrove mudflats&#160;and feeding on exposed coral reefs (Solomon Islands, Pacific) (Cramp and Simmons 1983). <strong><br/>Diet </strong><em>Breeding</em> The breeding diet of this species includes many beetles, weevils, fly larvae, stalk worms and crabs (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).<em> Non-breeding</em> During the non-breeding season this species takes insects, crustaceans (such as crabs and amphipods), molluscs (particularly bivalves) and polycheate worms (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).<strong> <br/>Breeding site</strong> The nest of this species is a shallow scrape in bare sand or shingle (nesting pairs may often utilise cattle footprints), sometimes beside bushes and big stones, often amongst lichens and <em>Drias</em>&#160;(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).",
        "threats": "As for many shorebird species in the East Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), there is mounting direct and indirect evidence that this species is exposed to a myriad of threats at all stages of its migration cycle. On the breeding grounds, breeding productivity is thought to be reducing for this and other shorebird species due to climate change (Meltofte <em>et al</em>. 2007, Eikelenboom 2016), in particular due to interrupted trophic relationships and an increase in nest predation (Kubelka&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;<br/>Perhaps the greatest concentration of threats occurs on passage. Since the early 2000s, land reclamation in China was considered a significant threat to this species (and all East Asian-Australasian Flyway shorebirds); astonishingly, the extent of reclaimed land along the Yellow Sea coastline now exceeds the extent of remaining intertidal mudflat (IUCN 2023), suggesting that this may have contributed greatly to declines in this species. The rate of habitat lost to land reclamation has slowed since a peak in <em>c</em>. 2013, in particular in recent years due to the promised near-ceasing of land reclamation in China in early 2018 (Melville 2018); however, recent satellite data suggests that the extent of intertidal mudflat has continue to decrease, in large part due to continued reclamations in the Korean Peninsula (IUCN 2023). Mudflats have also continued to degrade in suitability for this species and other shorebirds because of the invasive alien <em>Spartina alterniflora </em>cordgrass, which appears to be spreading; in recent (post 2020) years, this threat has probably driven greater declines than planned land reclamation.&#160;In addition to land reclamation, coastal development and a rapid increase in the human population along the coastline of the Yellow Sea has led to widespread degradation of mudflats and coastal habitats used by this species; IUCN (2023) (and references therein) cite the follows as additional drivers of mudflat loss and degradation: 'processes such as changes in sediment supply, loss of coastal vegetation associated with development...erosion, redistribution of sediments due to storms, and compaction and subsidence (sinking) caused by subsurface resource and groundwater extraction are also likely to be factors'. Offshore windfarms may have a so far unquantified impact on birds due to collisions (unlikely) and displacement and disturbance of feeding birds (more likely). Disturbance on mudflats by fishermen and others using the mudflats may also be reasonably considered a threat. Hunting is also possibly a significant threat impacting this species on its Russian breeding grounds (see, e.g., Klokov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2023) and on passage (Gallo-Cajiao&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). In Australia, where most birds winter, Rogers <em>et al</em>. (2021) considered there to be 'no major threats with most birds [wintering] along sparsely populated coasts'.",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong>The main conservation actions currently being implemented to the benefit this species are on its migration routes,&#160;China is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to clear tidal mudflats of <em>Spartina </em>cordgrass, with the aim of eliminating 90% of it by 2025; locally, this has already been successful, for example at Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve (Stokstad 2023). The governments of China and South Korea have halted new projects that require or depend upon land reclamation, and across the Korean Peninsula the number of coastal wetlands has increased; moreover in China and South Korea, key areas for migratory shorebirds (including <em>C. mongolus</em>) have been identified and prioritised by government and two World Heritage nominations have been made on these grounds&#160;(IUCN 2023). Although data on scale or impact are sparse, IUCN (2023) consider that \"support for coastal wetland conservation and wise-use appears to have increased over the last decade. There has been a substantial increase in the number of volunteer groups and NGOs helping to monitor the migrations of shorebirds and other waterbirds, as well as increased media coverage and special events, demonstrating enhanced awareness among coastal communities (see also EAAFP 2016). North Korea became a Party to the Ramsar Convention and joined the EAAF Partnership in 2018, demonstrating their commitment to the conservation of coastal wetlands.<br/>In 2021, the 'Regional Flyway Initiative' (RFI) was set up by the Asian Development Bank, with technical support from BirdLife International, with the aim of protecting and restoring priority wetland ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide in the East-Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), the most threatened flyway globally. The Initiative is slated for implementation in 10 East, South and Southeast Asian countries:&#160; Mongolia, China*, Bangladesh, Viet Nam*, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Philippines*, Thailand, Malaysia* and Indonesia*, many of which (those marked by *) are used by <em>C. mongolus</em>&#160;on northbound and southbound migrations between breeding and wintering areas. The RFI will mobilise large-scale financing to support the protection, sustainable management and restoration of at least 50 priority wetlands across ten Asian countries, with an initial financing commitment of $3 billion from the ADB (BirdLife International 2022). Over time, the RFI aims to enhance and expand the existing efforts in conserving and managing priority wetlands identified on the basis of supporting globally significant congregations of migratory waterbirds, and&#160; leverage on collaborative opportunities with stakeholders including national governments, civil society organizations, communities, regional organisations like the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The main action needed for this species and other EAAF shorebirds is the amelioration of threats on its migration, which are currently thought to be the principal cause of its decline. While progress has been over the past decade, all land reclamations need to be halted in all range states and remaining mudflats protected. China needs to implement its plan to eliminate 90+% of <em>Spartina </em>cordgrass. The discharge of toxic pollutants into coastal wetlands (especially where there are large shorebird congregations) needs to be controlled. Further degradation of mudflats needs to be stopped, including monitoring and preventing detrimental release of riverine sediments and responsible planning of offshore windfarms. In order to evaluate the success of the conservation actions listed above, robust monitoring is needed, preferably at all stages of its migration cycle, but especially in Australia where baseline data are readily available. Perhaps the greatest research gap is on the species' breeding grounds. It is unclear what threats are faced by the species while breeding (particularly whether breeding productivity is decreasing in the face of climate change and increased predation etc.).&#160;Continue to develop identification criteria to better inform the wintering distribution of this species, in particular determining how many birds winter in Wallacea and New Guinea.",
        "use_trade": "Trapped, as are most shorebirds, on migration, especially for this species in Russia, China and the Philippines (reviewed by Gallo-Cajiao <em>et al</em>. 2020, Yong <em>et al</em>. 2022). In Kamchatka, for example,&#160;6,000 small shorebirds were hunted in 2019 (Klokov <em>et al</em>. 2023), some of which were probably this species.",
        "rationale": "This species is one of many shorebirds in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway that is in steep decline. It breeds only in Far Eastern Russia, before migrating south through East Asia to winter (mostly) in Australia. There are a large number of threats impacting this species across this flyway, especially on passage where land reclamation for urban development, and invasion by <em>Spartina </em>cordgrass, has considerably reduced the area of suitable habitat available to it. On its breeding grounds, climate change may also be having an effect, but the impact of this threat on Siberian Sandplover<em>&#160;</em>is poorly known. Data suggest that these threats have driven population declines of&#160;50–62% over the past three generations (2010–2023). If threats are not ameliorated, and declines do not slow or cease, then this species is at a relatively high risk of becoming extinct in the near-future. Accordingly it is listed as Endangered.",
        "trend_justification": "All available data (almost entirely from the species’ wintering grounds in Australia) indicate a sharp reduction in the number of birds over the past three generations. Many of threats facing this species are imprecisely known (at least in terms of scale and relative contribution) and few have been mitigated or ameliorated. These threats are therefore projected to continue into the future. Using the data available to them (cited in parentheses), Rogers<em> et al</em>. (2021) estimated a rate of reduction of 56% over the past three generations, averaging trend data from: −62% (Clemens<em> et al</em>. 2016), −55% (Studds <em>et al.</em> 2017), −56% (Clemens <em>et al.</em> 2019; Waterbird meta-analysis) and −50% (Clemens <em>et al</em>. 2019; Generalised Additive Model to three generations). The generation length used by those authors is nearly identical to that used here (4.30 years vs. 4.44 years) hence these values are applicable here. Although these data are several years out of date, there has been no apparent recovery in population (R. Fuller <em>in litt.</em> 2023) and, precautionarily, these rates of decline are thought to be applicable for the three generations to 2023. A rapid recovery/rebound is considered unlikely, hence these rates are also applied to a moving window of 2012-2025. The rate of decline for the next three generations (2023-2036) is considered highly uncertain, but its suspected to be slightly slower due to the ceasing of land reclamation, and planned conservation action on <em>Spartina </em>cord grass. It is therefore set in the range of 30-49%.",
        "taxonomic_notes": "<em>Charadrius mongolus</em> and <em>C. atrifrons</em> were previously lumped as <em>C. mongolus</em> (Handbook of the Birds of the World and BirdLife International 2022); see under <em>C. atrifrons</em>. Subspecies name <em>stegmanni</em> is a replacement for <em>litoralis</em>, latter name being invalid, as preoccupied. Two subspecies recognised."

        "range": "Historically this species was widespread through the Greater Sundas, where it occurred from the southernmost end of Peninsular <strong>Thailand</strong>&#160;and <strong>Myanmar</strong>, south through Peninsular <strong>Malaysia</strong>, and on Sumatra, <strong>Indonesia</strong>, and Borneo, where it is recorded from all states, including <strong>Brunei</strong>. It is now effectively extinct in Thailand, although sightings in neighbouring Lenya National Park, Myanmar, suggest birds may have the propensity to wander into Thai territory (e.g. Cutter <em>et al</em>. 2007). There are recent records from all other parts of the range, although the species occurs at a very low density and is nowhere numerous.",
        "population": "The population size of this species has not recently been formally estimated. In Thailand, any population that persists must be wholly relictual, and potential future records are likely to stem from neighbouring Myanmar, where there are sightings from Lenya National Park (eBird 2023). In Myanmar itself, there is little habitat away from Lenya, where sightings are sporadic and rare, suggesting only a tiny (&lt;10 pairs) population persists. In Peninsular Malaysia, there are no records away from Taman Negara in the past decade, and here too the population is assumed to be tiny (again, set arbitrarily to &lt;10 pairs). On Sumatra, too, the population is assumed to be relatively small, with recent records from only Siberut Island, Way Kambas National Park, the Kampar Peninsula (RER 2017, eBird 2023). Danielsen <em>et al</em>. (1997) estimated that there were fewer than 100 mature individuals left on Sumatra and there is little doubt the population will have reduced since then following the contraction of lowland peatswamp forest. Accordingly, and incorporating the number and spread of eBird (2023) records, the Sumatran population (including Siberut) is estimated at 50–100 mature individuals.<br/>Modern records in Sabah are concentrated along the Kinabatangan River (in large part a reflection of observer effort). However there are also records from other large areas of lowland forest, including Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Deramakot Forest Reserve and Danum Conservation Area. The number of individuals at these sites is ultimately unknown, although observers rarely record more than 1-2 individuals at one time (eBird 2023).&#160;Records from Brunei and Sarawak are sporadic and typically refer to single birds flying over (eBird 2023); it is therefore unclear whether these refer to breeding individuals, or wanderers from elsewhere on Borneo. Certainly, the area of suitable habitat for the species here is now small and greatly reduced, as is reflected by the scarcity of other large-bodied peatswamp forest specialists in these areas (e.g.&#160;<em>Lophura pyronota</em>,&#160;<em>Rhyticeros undulatus</em>), despite them being collected there historically (BirdLife International 2001, Mann 2008). Within Borneo itself, there can be little doubt that Kalimantan now hosts (perhaps considerably) more birds than anywhere else, with particular strongholds in the peatswamp forests of Central Kalimantan and East Kalimantan provinces. Nonetheless, even here data suggest that it occurs at a very low density and/or ranges widely (see summary of recent records in Kalimantan presented in Martin <em>et al</em>. 2022). Across Borneo, Singh <em>et al</em>. (2021) estimated that the area of suitable habitat for Storm's Stork was (in 2010) only 3,950 km<sup>2</sup>. Applying a density of just 20-40 mature individuals within 1,100 km<sup>2</sup> of primary forest on Sumatra (per Danielsen <em>et al</em>. 1997) suggests a Bornean population size of 80-160 mature individuals, however there are several reasons this is improbably low. Foremost, in several areas of Kalimantan, data suggest that this species can occur at a considerably higher density where habitat is optimal: for example, Purbowo <em>et al</em>. (2017) found nine birds in a very small (&lt;1 km<sup>2</sup>) area of swamp forest along the Kepuluk river. Moreover, such a low density is difficult to rationalise with the frequency and spread of recent records (e.g. eBird 2023), even accepting that this species is mobile and most frequently observed when soaring. For these reasons, across the optimal habitat identified by Singh <em>et al</em>. (2021), densities are suspected of being 3–10x higher than those suggested by Danielsen <em>et al</em>. (1997), which produces an overall density far more consistent with the numbers and frequency of Storm's Storks observed by citizen scientists (eBird 2023) and reported in the literature (e.g., Martin <em>et al</em>. 2022). Therefore, the population on Borneo is estimated number 240–1,600 mature individuals.<br/>Data across this species' global range suggest that previous estimations of a global population &lt;350 mature individuals (M. Silvius <em>in litt</em>. 2002, Y. Noor Rusila <em>in litt</em>. 2002) was possibly pessimistic, notwithstanding the rapid rate of reduction the population size has probably experienced over the past 50 years. Nonetheless, the lower bounds of each area calculated here sum to only <em>c</em>. 300 mature individuals, suggesting that this is a plausible scenario. However, a much larger upper bound (<em>c</em>. 1,750) is used here, accounting for the great uncertainty over the total population on Borneo (in particular Kalimantan).",
        "habitats": "It occurs at low densities in large, undisturbed blocks of level lowland forest, particularly freshwater and peat-swamp forests, on the floodplains of large rivers. It also frequents disturbed, recently burned and logged areas, and occasionally areas subject to tidal movements, although these may constitute suboptimal habitats and breeding records are confined to primary forest (Danielsen <em>et al</em>. 1997, Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is generally solitary, but is occasionally found in small groups. Two eggs are usually laid and the chicks are able to fly after <em>c</em>. 90 days. <p></p>",
        "threats": "This species is suspected to have declined by 40-60% over the past three generations (31 years: 1992-2023). The main, if not entire, cause of such rapid declines is the widespread and large-scale clearance of the lowland forests upon which this depends (Berdie 2008) to make space for plantations, chiefly oil-palm and, to a lesser extent, rubber and timber. These losses have disproportionately impacted peatswamp forests (Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011), which host the largest populations of this species. While this species has been observed in degraded habitats, there is no evidence they can persist in plantations, and breeding has been observed only in primary forest (see Discussion in Martin <em>et al</em>. [2022]). Forest fires are also a risk, especially in dry El Niño years (Harrison <em>et al</em>. 2016). There is little evidence this species is  hunted; incidental (mostly subsistence)  hunting almost certainly occurs, but there is no evidence this is a  factor in its decline.<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Legally protected in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. This species occurs in numerous protected areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2023), which combined protect over 11% of suitable habitat (see Singh <em>et al</em>. 2021).<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue further surveys to determine its distribution, population and habitat requirements, particularly in Kalimantan (e.g. Cheyne&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Establish further protected areas at sites supporting significant populations, including gazetting proposed reserves, particularly on Sumatra and in Kalimantan. Lobby for the cessation of logging in swamp-forests. Improve effectiveness of protection measures in protected areas in Indonesia.<p></p>",
        "use_trade": "It is perhaps surprising that there is little evidence this species is hunted given it is a large-bodied bird. Incidental (mostly subsistence) hunting almost certainly occurs, but there is no evidence this is a factor in its decline.",
        "rationale": "<em>Ciconia stormi </em>is native to the swamp and plains-level forests of the Greater Sundas, where it occurs at a very low density and nowhere is numerous. Over the past three generations (31 years: 1992–2023), it is suspected of having declined rapidly (40–60%) in response to industrial removal of its habitat for agro-industry plantations, particularly oil-palm and rubber. Its global population size is uncertain, but probably numbers 300–1,750 mature individuals; with ongoing habitat loss compounded by forest fires which may increase with frequency in response to climate change, this species is considered to be a high risk of extinction in the near-term. Accordingly, it is listed as Endangered.",
        "trend_justification": "Although there are no direct population data for this species from which to accurately derive trends, comparing the spread of historic records (e.g. BirdLife International 2001, Mann 2008), with more recent data (eBird 2023), indicates that there is no doubt <em>Ciconia stormi</em> has greatly contracted its range over the past three generations, with it no longer being found at many sites it once occupied. The landscape-scale removal of swamp and plains-level forests for plantations (principally oil palm, but also rubber) has been the principal driver of this (Miettinen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011), and while rates of forest loss have recently slowed (especially in Kalimantan: Global Forest Watch 2023), the practice still continues and there is no reason to suspect that this species has ceased declining. Moreover, some populations (especially those in Peninsular Malaysia and, perhaps, on Sumatra) are now so small and isolated, with very little breeding habitat, that they may not be viable population units in the future. Accordingly, the species is inferred to be undergoing a continuing decline.<br/>The rate of decline over the past three generations is more difficult to determine, in part owing to knowledge gaps in this species' habitat tolerances. Although it has frequently been observed in degraded forest (e.g., Martin <em>et al</em>. 2022, and sources listed therein), Berdie (2008) determined that the species is nonetheless dependent on (nearby) closed canopy forest, and the only breeding records have been from lowland primary forest (Danielsen <em>et al</em>. 1997, Posa and Marques 2012). In the absence of other data from which to generate more robust trends, remote sensing data and the extent of suitable habitat are used as a proxy for population size. Between 2000 and 2023, the extent of forest cover within this species' elevational range reduced by 34–39%, depending on the assumptions used (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). This is equivalent to a rate of <em>c</em>.44–53% over three generations. To account for additional uncertainty (for example, whether fragmentation or degradation has had any impact), over the past three generations (31 years: 1992–2023) the rate of decline is placed in a broader bracket of 40–60%. Given this species is long-lived, slow to breed, and unlikely to recover quickly, the population is also suspected of having declined by 40–60% between 1995 and 2026 (thus meeting the thresholds for Endangered under Criteria A2 and A4). Rates of future decline are far more difficult to predict. Only 11.5% of suitable habitat identified by Singh <em>et al</em>. (2021) is protected, however the same authors also determined that habitat loss between 2010 and 2050 would be only 16.6–19.2% under a range of land-use and climate change scenarios. In the period 2020–2022, the rate of forest cover loss in this species' range also fell (to an equivalent rate of 15–22% over three generations: Global Forest Watch 2023), in large part due to a slow down in forest loss in Kalimantan. Given the long generation length and resulting large window, accurately predicting population declines over the next three generations (31 years: 2023–2054) is very challenging, but is here suspected to lie somewhere in the bracket 10–40%, incorporating the fact that future declines are likely, but at a rate probably slower than those observed in the past.",

The rate of forest cover loss recorded through satellite monitoring has been slow in the past two decades, and in the three generations to 2022, the maximum rate is estimated at 4.0% (Global Forest Watch 2023, using Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] data and methods disclosed therein).

The small range indicates that the species may be at risk, although the population is not severely fragmented.

        "range": "<em>Accipiter butleri</em><strong> </strong>is endemic to the Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal, <strong>India</strong>, where it is only known with certainty from Kamorta, Katchall, Nancowry and Car Nicobar islands (Pande <em>et al. </em>2007, Sundaramoorthy 2010, eBird 2023, Sivaperuman <em>et al. </em>2018). As many islands in the archipelago are poorly studied, it is possible that it is more widely distributed, although it is considered unlikely that this species occurs in the South Nicobar Islands (Praveen J <em>in litt</em>. 2023).<p></p>",
        "population": "The status and population size of this species are very poorly known. There are no recent confirmed sightings of the nominate taxon from Car Nicobar, where there has apparently been widespread conversion of forest to coconut palm plantations (Praveen J&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2023). During three years of surveys, R. Sankaran sighted 20-25 individuals of this species in its entire known range, and no sightings of this species were obtained in the coastal habitats of the Nicobar Islands during fieldwork in 2006 (K. Sivakumar&#160;<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt</span>. 2012), whilst fieldwork from March 2009 to August 2011 produced only two sightings of single birds on Nancowry Island (A. P. Zaibin&#160;<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt</span>. 2012). In recent eBird checklists from Kamorta and Nancowry, it is the least frequently recorded endemic. Robust estimates of abundance are lacking, but evidence strongly supports that this species occurs at a low density. Accordingly, and acknowledging considerable uncertainty, the population is suspected to number 500-2,500 mature individuals.",
        "habitats": "This species is apparently restricted to forested habitats, mostly below 100 m (Ferguson-Lees &amp; Christie 2001). There is very little information available about its breeding and feeding ecology, but lizards and insects have been recorded as food items (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).   <p></p>",
        "threats": "The primary threat to this species appears to be habitat loss and degradation, and this has accelerated since the arrival of migrants from mainland India in the late 1960s. Clearance for agriculture and urban development have increased greatly, and much of Car Nicobar, for example, is now coconut palm plantations (Praveen J <em>in litt</em>. 2023). Hunting with airguns has become far commoner in recent years (A. Singh <em>in litt</em>. 2023), although it is unknown whether this species is hunted or, if it is, at an intensity that is driving declines.<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is protected under Indian Wildlife legislation. No targeted conservation measures are known to have been implemented and there are no large protected areas in its range.<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct detailed surveys of the archipelago to determine the true size, distribution and trends of the species' population. Document the current status on Car Nicobar, from which there are no recent records. Investigate its ecological requirements.&#160;Develop a community-governed protected area on Katchall (K. Sivakumar<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> in litt</span>. 2012).   <p></p>",
        "use_trade": "Reportedly there is an increase in air rifle use in this species' range (A. Singh&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2023), although it is unclear whether this species is hunted as a result.",
        "rationale": "Nicobar Sparrowhawk is a very poorly known species known definitely from only four islands in the poorly studied Nicobar archipelago. It therefore has a small range and probably a small population, and is suspected to be declining because of habitat loss and degradation. Moreover, it occurs at only a handful of Locations. Accordingly, it is listed as Vulnerable.<p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "In the most recent three generations (16 years: 2006-2022) forest cover extent in the species' range reduced by <em>c</em>. 5% (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). Given that the species is apparently restricted to forest habitats, it is suspected to be declining at a similar rate to that of forest loss. Moreover, habitat degradation, and potentially some hunting (A. Singh <em>in litt</em>. 2023) may be driving additive declines, although the latter threat is wholly speculative. Accordingly, the species is suspected to be declining at an ongoing rate of 5-15%.",

Its wintering grounds are improperly known, but certainly include Peninsular <strong>Malaysia</strong>, and Sumatra and Java, <strong>Indonesia </strong>(see Janra <em>et al</em>. 2019), and the Philippines. On passage, it is recorded in a number of states including China, <strong>Viet Nam</strong>, <strong>Lao PDR</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong>, and presumably <strong>Myanmar</strong>. It has been recorded on Borneo, and may be more regular thereon than records suggest.",
        "population": "The global population size of this species has not been formally estimated. The abundances of each 'subspecies group' (<em>sensu </em>del Hoyo and Collar 2016)&#160;is discussed separately: <br/>The population size of 'Japanese Paradise-flycatcher' <em>T. a. atrocaudata</em>&#160;has not been estimated, but is described as fairly common by Chikara (2019), and citizen science data (eBird 2023) reveal it to be widespread and relatively common; see also&#160;Bird Breeding Distribution Survey Committee (2021). Similarly, 'Ryukyu Paradise-flycatcher' <em>T. a. illex</em>&#160;is described as fairly common by Chikara (2019) and although its population size is likely to be much smaller than <em>T. a. atrocaudata</em>, citizen science data show it to be widespread (eBird 2023). The population of 'Lanyu Paradise-flycatcher'&#160;<em>T. a. periophthalmica </em>on Lanyu was estimated as being as high as <em>c. </em>1,000 breeding pairs by&#160;Späth&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2018) in only 12 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of suitable habitat. This taxon also occurs on the Batanes Islands, where descriptions of its abundance as 'common' (Allen 2020), and citizen science data (showing counts of more than 20 individuals on relatively short (&lt;4 km) transects), indicate it is similarly common. Given the Batanes Islands contain almost 70 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat, the total population size of <em>T. a.&#160;</em><em>periophthalmica </em>alone is likely to be several thousand mature individuals. Consequently, although the total population size is set here to unknown (owing to immense uncertainty regarding the population size of the most numerous taxon (nominate <em>atrocaudata</em>)), there is high confidence that it is moderately large, and exceeds (probably greatly) 10,000 mature individuals.",
        "habitats": "This species breeds in mature deciduous or mixed forest and plantations on low hills and mountains, up to 1,000 m. In central Japan, wooded valleys at lower elevations are preferred. On the wintering grounds, records are from various forest habitats up to 700 m, including mangroves. On migration, it is also recorded from open woodland, suburban parks and gardens in lowlands.  <p></p>",
        "threats": "The main threats to this species are on its wintering grounds in Indonesia and the Philippines. Here, forest loss and degradation, especially in the Sumatran lowlands, is a possible threat, although when not breeding this species appears tolerant of habitat degradation, and the stable/increasing population on its breeding grounds suggests that it is not driving population declines. In Indonesia, it is also known to have occasionally been caught for the songbird trade (Janra <em>et al</em>. 2019) however this is thought to be sporadic, localised and unlikely to be driving population declines. Nonetheless, this threat should continue to be closely monitored.&#160;<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Listed in CMS Appendix II. On its breeding, passage and wintering grounds, occurs in numerous protected areas. In some parts of its range, forest protection programmes have shown some success (e.g., Yu 2008, Späth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). No specific action is known, although this species undoubtedly benefits from general protected area conservation.<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>More precisely define its wintering distribution and determine whether, in Indonesia, trapping for the songbird trade is a more considerable threat than currently assumed. Continue to protect significant areas of suitable habitat, especially on its wintering grounds where potential threats may be more acute.",
        "use_trade": "There is no evidence of trapping or trade in its breeding grounds, however in Indonesia this species has occasionally been so (see Janra <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, this is not considered to be a major threat for this species.",
        "rationale": "This species has a very large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population trend appears to be stable, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.",
        "trend_justification": "Although declines were noted historically (BirdLife International 2001), primarily owing to the loss of habitat in the 19th and 20th centuries in Japan, there is no evidence these are ongoing (Späth <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Japan Bird Atlas indicates an increase in the number of confirmed or likely breeding grid squares from 204 in 1997-2002 to 411 in 2016-2021 (Breeding Bird Distribution Survey Committee 2021), and on Lanyu the population was also interpreted to be increasing in parallel with the increase in habitat extent on the island (Späth <em>et al</em>. 2018). Elsewhere, the trend is effectively unknown, although there is little indication that the species is globally in decline. As such the population is assessed as stable or possibly increasing.",

        "population": "Brazil (2009) estimated a population size of between c.100 and 10,000 breeding pairs, although the lower bound of this estimate is highly improbable given that there remains 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> of forest within its mapped range. eBird (2023) data suggest it is commonly encountered, although&#160;Severinghaus (2010) describe it as 'local'. The population size is not quantified here in the absence of robust data, however it is evaluated as unlikely to be especially small.",
        "habitats": "This species occurs in primary broadleaved forest and occasionally secondary growth at 700-2,500 m (Severinghaus 2010).<p></p>",
        "threats": "Historically, large areas of Taiwan's native forests were cleared for timber extraction, although this impacted lowland areas more than those in the mountains. In the last 20 years, there has been almost no deforestation registered according to remote sensing data (per Global Forest Watch 2023) and the majority (&gt;70%) of the species' range now lies within Taiwan's extensive protected area network (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2023).",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Much (&gt;70%) of its range is contained within protected areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2023).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to monitor habitat trends using remote sensing data. Establish a monitoring protocol that directly assess the trend of this species and others.",
        "use_trade": "Historically this species was apparently desirable for the pet trade, although there is no indication this is ongoing at a scale capable of causing a reduction in population size; or indeed at all.",
        "rationale": "Although this species has a moderately small range, there is no evidence for continuing declines in any parameters, thus it does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population trend of this species is believed to be stable, hence it does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is unknown, but is not suspected to be small, hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.<p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "There are no direct population trend data for this species, although there has been no overall habitat loss in the past 20 years (per Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen <em>et al</em>.&#160;[2013] and methods disclosed therein). Although it has historically been caught for the bird trade, there is no published evidence this is ongoing or occurring at a scale thought capable of causing a population reduction. In the absence of other threats, the population is suspected to be stable.",

        "range": "Endemic to South and South-East Asia (range states discussed broadly west to east). In <strong>Pakistan</strong>, principally confined to the Indus Delta region, chiefly in wetland areas south of Karachi, although its true distribution/abundance is obfuscated by low effort (eBird 2023). Occurs effectively throughout <strong>India </strong>(including far from water),&#160;although is commonest in the west and south, but only narrowly in southernmost <strong>Nepal</strong>&#160;(chiefly in summer). Common and widespread in <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>. In Bangladesh, rather sparsely distributed but with concentrations along the Padma (especially near Rajshahi) and more sporadically in the Sundarbans. Scarce too in <strong>Myanmar</strong>, chiefly along the Ayeyarwady River and Delta. Increasingly widespread in <strong>Thailand</strong>, although with records concentrated around the Gulf of Thailand and Bangkok. In <strong>Lao PDR</strong>&#160;formally more widespread and there appear to be no very recent records (Timmins <em>et al</em>. in prep., eBird 2023); nonetheless, wanderers may occur in the country's far south. In <strong>Cambodia</strong>&#160;widespread in suitable habitat, with breeding concentrations around Tonle Sap. In <strong>Viet Nam</strong>, frequent records from only the south, but occasional records in Xuan Thuy National Park suggest it may be more widespread. Wanderers have occasionally reached China, but there is no evidence it is anything but a vagrant here. In Peninsular&#160;<strong>Malaysia</strong>, there is a population centred around Kuala Lumpur that has originated from escapes, with a second population at the Peninsular's southernmost tip, where wanderers from a second escaped population (which may at this point, be near joining) in <strong>Singapore</strong>&#160;occasionally cross the border (Puan <em>et al</em>. 2020). There is significant concern that these escaped population may stray to neighbouring Indonesia and interbreed with the Endangered <em>Mycteria cinerea</em>&#160;(Baveja <em>et al</em>. 2019). In time, the expansion of native birds from Thailand may reach Malaysia.",
        "population": "The population size is not well known. Perennou <em>et al.</em> (1994) estimated populations of 15,000 individuals in South Asia, and 'fewer than 10,000 individuals' in South-East Asia, with an estimated global total of 15,000-25,000 individuals. Wetlands International (2022) now estimate 25,000 individuals in South Asia (although there is little indication that this more than arbitrary) and retain the estimate of 5,000-10,000 in South-East Asia between 1987 and 1990. Few additional data are available from India, however a report of 4,000 nesting birds at a single location (Veerapuram Village) on the Andhra Pradesh-Karnataka border (V. Santharam <em>in litt</em>. 2023) suggests that the estimate for South Asia from Wetlands International (2022) may be pessimistic. A wider bound of 15,000-50,000 is therefore used here. There is also additional empirical evidence to suggest that the South-East Asia estimate used by Wetlands International (2022) is too small; for example, more than 3,000 pairs (thus 6,000 mature individuals) were counted in Cambodia in 2021 (WCS unpublished data). Consequently, it is probable that the total number of birds (including non-breeding individuals) in South-East Asia is now substantially more than 7,000, and may even exceed 10,000. In the absence of other data, the values collated here are accepted, albeit with low confidence. Thus, the global population is suspected to number somewhere in a broad bracket of 20,000-60,000 mature individuals. Better data, especially from South Asia, where this species is not confined to wetland habitats, but also uses farmland and agricultural landscapes, should be a priority for future research.",
        "habitats": "It frequents a wide range of open habitats, not just wetlands. Freshwater habitats used include marshes, lakes, reservoirs, flooded fields, rice paddies, irrigation channels, swamp forest and river banks. It also uses farmland, especially where close to water. More occasionally, it visits intertidal mudflats (especially in Thailand) and saltpans.",
        "threats": "The global population trend of this species is thought to be increasing, such that any threat is unlikely to driving global population declines. Nonetheless, locally threats do remain for this species, especially in South-East Asia where habitat loss, disturbance, pollution, wetland drainage and hunting all remain threats of varying extents. Escaped populations of this species in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore pose a risk to the genetic integrity of Milky Stork <em>M. cinerea</em>, especially if they cross over into the latter's stronghold on Sumatra (Baveja <em>et al</em>. 2019). In South Asia, some nesting sites are threatened by development projects. Historically, hunting was considered the principal threat to this species (especially in South-East Asia), and this is thought to have led to its extirpation as a breeding species in Lao PDR (Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press) historically and, more recently, significant declines in Cambodia until the early 2000s.",
        "measures": "<strong style=\"\">Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Landscape-scale monitoring of breeding and foraging populations on agricultural areas in South Asia has been coordinated by the International Crane Foundation and the Nature Conservation Foundation since 2011 (G. Sundar<em style=\"\"> in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;It occurs in a number of protected areas but a large number also occur in agricultural areas with no formal designation. Monitoring is captured by several schemes including State of India's Birds (which uses complete eBird checklists from which to derive trends) and Wetlands International (who mostly use the Asian Waterbird Census data). It is classified as a Rare Species under Cambodian law (Visal and Mahood 2015). Since 2004 the colony at Prek Toal, Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia, has been successfully protected and monitored by MoE staff who work with former egg collectors. Breeding numbers have increased considerably in response, from <em>c</em>. 1,000 nests in 2004, to over 3,000 in 2021 (WCS unpublished data).<p></p><strong style=\"\">Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to regularly monitor known colonies throughout the species range. Ensure complete and permanent protection of all breeding congregations. Encourage farming systems that create and not destroy suitable foraging habitat. Mitigate against development schemes which destroy sites where it is found. Conduct awareness campaigns involving local residents to engender pride in the species and other large waterbirds and prevent hunting.  <p></p>",
        "use_trade": "In some areas, continues to be hunted as adults, and as eggs/chicks. This threat is particularly acute in South-East Asia, although protection of some sites (e.g. Tonle Sap, Cambodia: Goes 2013) has vastly reduced hunting pressures over the past 3-4 decades, such that the overall population trend now appears to be increasing almost throughout its range.",
        "rationale": "This species has a large range that extends from South Asia through to South-East Asia, with a population trend that appears to be increasing. In some parts (especially South-East Asia), this is due to concerted conservation action and the protection of breeding colonies. Because numbers are increasing, and the population is estimated to number more than 20,000 mature individuals, the extinction risk of this this species is considered very low. Accordingly, it is considered Least Concern.<p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "Although numbers counted fluctuate annually (largely in response to observer effort/coverage, as well as annual shifts in distribution), numbers counted in the Asian Waterbird Census show no obvious trend (Li <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kar <em>et al</em>. 2018). Data (International Wetlands Census) from Cambodia and Thailand (see&#160;Langendoen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021) show an increase in population size&#160;for 2011-2020 (1.249) and 2002-2020 (1.0436), leading Wetlands International (2022) to regard the South-East Asian subpopulation to be increasing overall. Although the population in Malaysia (centred around Kuala Lumpur) is estimated to be increasing exponentially (Zakaria and Nor 2019), this is considered feral (Puan <em>et al</em>. 2020, MNS Bird Conservation Council 2021).<br/>The trend of the South Asian population is uncertain, with no empirical trend from Wetlands International since. However, in northern India there has been no evidence for recent declines (G. Sundar <em>in litt</em>. 2016) and numbers counted and published via the Asian Waterbird Census have shown no obvious trend (Wetlands International South Asia 2020). In Kerala, the last two decades has seen a large influx of the species into wetlands, where they are now breeding (e.g. Moses 2015); and recent trend data from Keoladeo National Park show signs of population recovery (Dwevedi <em>et al</em>. 2021). There are, however, some reports of local declines in Maharashtra (G. Jathar <em>in litt</em>. 2023).&#160;It is acknowledged that these sources do not cover every facet of this species' conservation status, exhibiting a particular bias to wetland habitats (to which this species is not confined, being readily found in agricultural landscapes: eBird 2023, G. Sundar <em>in litt</em>. 2023). Nonetheless, they are suspected of being representative of broader global trends, and the noted range expansions in both South and South-East Asia indicate genuine population recovery throughout. Consequently, the global population is inferred to be slowly increasing.",

        "rationale": "<p>This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km² combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.<br/></p>",
        "trend_justification": "The population trend has not been investigated, but the only threat known to the species is the logging and fragmentation of forests within the range. Tree cover loss within the range is overall low (5% over three generations; Global Forest Watch 2023, using Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). Rates of habitat loss however vary considerably across the range (Global Forest Watch 2023). The species is strictly dependent on forest and as such, population declines may be exacerbated by additional forest degradation (see Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2016, B. Phalan <em>in litt</em>. 2023). Population declines are therefore placed in the band 1-19% over three generations. It is however noted that population declines, in line with habitat loss, may be locally higher (e.g. in Brazil; Aleixo <em>et al</em>. 2021).",

        "range": "<em>Otus mendeni</em> is endemic to Peleng in the Banggai Islands,<strong> Indonesia</strong> (König and Weick 2008). It is also known from Labobo (Coates and Bishop 1997) and may occur too on other islets of Peleng.",
        "population": "This species is confined to the island of Peleng (and Labobo) where it is described as 'fairly common'. Surveys conducted by Burung Indonesia (BirdLife in Indonesia) on Peleng found <em>Otus mendeni </em>at all 11 sites surveyed, including forest, plantations, palm thickets and woodlands (J. S. Udin <em>in litt</em>. 2023). In its range, approximately 1,800 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat remains (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). No precise density estimate for this species, or others closely related to it, are available, however densities of <em>Otus </em>are often relatively high on small islands (König and Weick 2008). Accordingly, a population size of roughly 10,000-40,000 mature individuals is suspected, equivalent to a combined density/occupancy of <em>c</em>.5-20 mature individuals/km<sup>2</sup>, which is considered accurate, if not precise.",
        "habitats": "Eaton <em>et al</em>. (2021) regard this as a fairly common species 'in woodland and plantations throughout [the island of Peleng]'. This summary is congruent with other descriptions of the species' tolerances, with Indrawan&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1997) hearing the species in an area of degraded lowland forest and Rheindt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2010) finding it common in primary and degraded forests, to over 900 m. More recently, surveys at 11 sites on Peleng found it at all, including in degraded forest (J. S. Udin <em>in litt</em>. 2023). Rheindt <em>et al</em>. (2014) heard it to 1,000 m, suggesting that it probably occurs to the island's peak (1,100 m).",
        "threats": "The principal threat to this species is logging and forest clearance for agricultural expansion. Although conversion to oil palm plantations had reportedly slowed by 2016 (M. Indrawan&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016), remote sensing data (Global Forest Watch 2023) indicate that, overall, the rate of forest cover loss since 2016 is no slower than the decade before. Forest is lost principally to slash and burn agriculture (J. S. Udin <em>in litt</em>. 2023). The impact of this forest cover loss on <em>Otus mendeni</em> is difficult to define: like most insular scops-owls, it appears to be tolerant of even substantial degradation, and has been observed in plantations and heavily degraded forest types (Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021, J. S. Udin <em>in litt</em>. 2023). Nonetheless, at least some of the forest cover observed between 2012 and 2022 appears amount to total clearance and undoubtedly affects this tree-dependent species. There is no evidence it is hunted, and apparently this is considered a taboo by local people on Peleng (J. S. Udin <em>in litt</em>. 2023).",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>No targeted conservation actions are known for this species, but more general conservation actions were outlined in Indrawan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2014). The authors suggest an effort of engagement with all relevant stakeholders including local communities, district government, and district parliamentarians with emphasis on building capacities of local communities for better and more sustainable tenure (M. Indrawan&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). In at least some parts of Peleng, local people remain concerned by economic impacts of sustainable schemes (Fathurrahman and Supriatna 2022). Moreover, Burung Indonesia are currently working on Peleng with the aim of reducing habitat loss and degradation by implementing awareness and education and mainstreaming endemic biodiversity protections into local government policy and programmes (J. S. Udin <em>in litt</em>. 2023).<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Carry out surveys to assess the population size. Study the species' ecology and habitat requirements. Continue to monitor changes in land-use on Peleng. Protect areas of suitable habitat, and try to help in the regeneration of forest (Indrawan&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014,&#160;M. Indrawan&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Support local communities to outline the indigenous territories under forest cover (M. Indrawan&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).",
        "use_trade": "Owls (including <em>Otus</em>) have becoming increasingly popular as pets in Indonesia (see, e.g., Nijman and Nekaris 2017), however there is no indication that this is yet affecting the present species. If it is, there is little probability of it being a major threat (currently).",
        "rationale": "This species is endemic to a handful of islands in the Banggai archipelago, off Sulawesi, Indonesia. Despite its small range, it is common and has a relatively large population size. There is some evidence that it is impacted by habitat loss (especially caused by slash and burn agriculture), but there is nothing to suggest declines are rapid, or that the species occurs at only a small number of Locations. Accordingly, it is listed as Near Threatened.",
        "trend_justification": "The population is suspected to be declining in response to ongoing habitat loss and degradation, although the rate of decline is difficult to determine. Remote sensing data (Global Forest Watch 2023, using data from Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein) indicate that <em>c</em>.12% of forest cover has been lost from this species' range in the ten years to 2022. However, the species is tolerant of habitat degradation and has been recorded in plantations and thinly wooded habitats (Rheindt <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2014; Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021, eBird 2023, J. S. Udin <em>in litt</em>. 2023), suggesting that forest cover loss may not be proportionate with population declines. Nonetheless, some forest losses are thought to amount to total clearance for agricultural land, and the species is therefore suspected of declining at an ongoing rate of <em>c</em>.1-9% over ten years.",
        "taxonomic_notes": "<em>Otus manadensis</em>, <em>O. mendeni</em> and <em>O. sulaensis</em> (del Hoyo and Collar 2014) were previously lumped as <em>O. manadensis</em> following Sibley and Monroe (1990, 1993)."

        "range": "<em>Aplonis zelandica</em> is endemic to Nendo and Vanikoro in the Santa Cruz islands of the <strong>Solomon Islands</strong> and most of <strong>Vanuatu</strong> south to Efate.&#160;<em><p></p></em>",
        "population": "The population is poorly known, but the species is described as uncommon to rare and occurs at very low population densities (Hadley and Parker 1965, G. Dutson pers. obs. 1998, Dutson 2011, G. Dutson <em>in litt. </em>2023). Assuming an effective detection distance of 10 m in closed forest, densities of around 5 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in the mountains of Santo (likely covering less than 1,000 km<sup>2</sup>), 30 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> on Nendo (500 km<sup>2</sup>), and &lt;1 individual/km<sup>2</sup> on Vanikoro (170 km<sup>2</sup>) have been suggested (G. Dutson<em> in litt. </em>2023). Assuming that only a proportion of the range is occupied to account for this species' rarity, the total population is estimated to fall within the range 2,500-10,000 mature individuals (with more than 1,000 mature individuals in the largest subpopulation).",
        "habitats": "It is a forest species of the lowlands on smaller islands and uplands on the larger islands on Vanuatu (Bregulla 1992)<strong></strong>, but is also often recorded in gardens and degraded forest on Nendo and Vanikoro (G. Dutson <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. It occurs from sea-level to over 1,000 m, but is usually commoner in hills, especially on Santo (Dutson 2011).<br/><p></p>",
        "threats": "Although the Vanuatu highland population is presumably above altitudes threatened by logging,&#160;lowland and hill forests across the species' range are thought to be subject to this threat (Craig and Feare 2020, G. Dutson<em>&#160;in litt.</em>&#160;2023), and remote sensing data indicate slow but ongoing forest loss within the range (Global Forest Watch 2022, using data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>[2013] and methods disclosed therein). There are records of the species from&#160;degraded forest and gardens, however overall its tolerance of forest loss and degradation is little known (G. Dutson&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2023). The species may be threatened by invasive rats (<em>Rattus</em> spp.) within the range (a threat that has caused rapid declines in congeners) (G. Dutson <em>in litt. </em>2023).<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong>No targeted conservation actions are known for this species.<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Research its tolerance of logged and degraded forest.   Regularly monitor the population at selected sites. Protect significant areas of primary forest at appropriate altitudes on all the islands throughout its range.<br/><p></p>",
        "use_trade": null,
        "rationale": "This species has a large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The species may be decreasing, however it does not meet or approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population is estimated to number less than 10,000 mature individuals, however there are thought to be more than 1,000 mature individuals in the largest subpopulation and hence it does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.<br/><p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "The species occurs at very low population densities, though there is no direct evidence of a decline. Remote sensing data (Global Forest Watch 2022, using data from Hansen <em>et al. </em>[2013] and methods disclosed therein) indicate slow but ongoing tree cover loss in this species range (&lt;2% within three generations). Although there are records of the species from&#160;degraded forest and gardens, overall its tolerance of forest loss and degradation is little known; it therefore remains a possibility that ongoing forest loss and associated impacts of degradation are affecting the population (G. Dutson <em>in litt.</em> 2023). Considering this along with the potential impacts of invasive rats within the range that have caused rapid declines in congeners, a decline is precautionarily suspected.<p></p>",

Ongoing monitoring of threats is also needed, as, due to the species's small population size, any emerging threats may rapidly cause the species to meet criteria for being globally threatened.

(1999) as being occupied by this species on account of a single specimen, is entirely obscure.&#160;On Palawan, there are records from Kinalaykayan and Dicabaitot, St Paul's Subterranean River National Park, Cleopatra's Needle, Buenavista, Iwahig Penal Colony, the vicinity of Puerto Princesa, Quezon at Tabon, Singnapan at Kabasakan, Pinikpikan and Tining-luan, Taguso, Mt Mantalingajan at Pinigisan and Tigwayan, Batarasa. Although described as rare and evidently a bird of lowland forest, the emerging evidence from knowledge of its voice is that it is much more common and more widespread than was supposed. <p></p>",
        "population": "This species is described as generally uncommon, but recent records from St Paul Subterranean National Park suggest it may be locally common (Allen 2020). Given that it has a relatively small range of not more than 27,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and occurs predominantly in lowland forest, the population is unlikely to exceed the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals. However, this is a preliminary estimate of poor data quality that requires clarification.",
        "habitats": "The species occurs primarily in lowland forest, but can adapt to secondary growth and mixed cultivation with trees (Allen 2020).&#160;<br/><br/><p></p>",
        "threats": "Ongoing habitat clearance through agricultural expansion and logging represent the main threats to this species. In the 10 years to 2022, forest cover on Palawan declined by c.9%, and the rate of forest loss appears to be increasing&#160;(Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein).<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>No species-specific actions are known, but the species has been recorded from St Paul's Subterranean River National Park. It is listed in CITES Appendix II.<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Protect areas of lowland forest within the species' range. Enforce restrictions on agricultural encroachment and logging within such protected areas. Generate density estimates to inform a revised population estimate for the species.&#160;<p></p>",

        "rationale": "This species is restricted to a relatively small range and is suspected to have a moderately small population that is declining due to forest loss. However, its appears at least somewhat tolerant of human-modified landscapes, therefore rates of population decline are suspected to be lower than those of forest loss. It is therefore listed as Least Concern. However,&#160;further research is needed into the species' population size and structure, and the impact of forest loss on the population.&#160;<br/><br/><p></p>",

In the ten years to 2022, forest cover on Palawan declined by c.9% (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). The rate of forest loss appears to be increasing - the reduction in tree cover over the next three generations is suspected to be c.12%, based on the rate of loss over the last five years (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). However, the species is reportedly tolerant of some habitat degradation, occurring in secondary growth and mixed cultivation (Allen 2020), therefore it is suspected to be declining at a rate somewhat slower than the rate of habitat loss.",

However, it occupies only a few small islands, with a range not more than 14,110 km<sup>2</sup>,&#160;therefore its population is thought to be moderately small.

In the 10 years to 2022, forest cover in the species's range declined by <em>c</em>.2% (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). During a recent trip to the southeastern part of Siberut Island, Haryoko <em>et al. </em>(2020) reported heavy logging and forest clearance for subsistence farming near the city of Muara Siberut. However, they also recorded several Mentawai Scops-owls in the area, suggesting that the species is at least somewhat tolerant of such habitat degradation.

        "range": "<em>Tyto inexspectata</em> is endemic to Sulawesi, <strong>Indonesia</strong>. Its distribution is poorly studied—there are multiple records from North Sulawesi and some from Lore Lindu National Park, Central Sulawesi (Mauro and Drijvers 2000, eBird 2023), but the southern limit of its range is essentially unknown. It was not, for example, detected in South-East Sulawesi by Berryman and Eaton (2020), where it might have reasonably been expected.<p></p>",
        "population": "The population size has not been quantified. It is described as scarce by Eaton <em>et al</em>. (2021) and citizen science data (eBird 2023) appear to support this suggestion, although it is likely to have relatively low detectability. It is noted that the area of forest within its mapped range is large (30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) and therefore it is unlikely to have an especially small population size, even if only a small proportion of the range is occupied.",
        "habitats": "It inhabits closed-canopy primary lowland, foothill and lower montane forests from 100-1,800 m (Mauro and Drijvers 2000, Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021). In more open areas and forest edge, it is replaced by <em>Tyto rosenbergii </em>(Eaton <em>et al. </em>2021)<em>.</em> It is presumably sedentary. <p></p>",
        "threats": "The loss, degradation and fragmentation of forests pose the major threat to the species, principally caused by land clearance for settlements, agricultural and infrastructural development and large-scale logging. High-quality, lowland forests have been the most impacted throughout (Voigt <em>et al</em>. 2021). This species also occurs at higher altitudes, buffering overall decline rates from the worst of forest loss, but ongoing threats are still thought to be causing significant declines which, when combined, may be driving population reductions equivalent to 10-19% over three generations.<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. It is known to occur in several National Parks, including Tangkoko, Bogani Nani Wartabone and Lore Lindu (eBird 2023).&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct widespread searches for the species in suitable habitat (using playback of its vocalisations) to clarify its range, distribution and population status. Reassess its conservation needs following these surveys, recommending further areas for protection where appropriate. Lobby for reduced logging of lower altitude forest in Sulawesi. <p></p>",
        "use_trade": null,
        "rationale": "This Sulawesi endemic has a relatively large range, within which it is suspected to be undergoing a slow population decline due to ongoing loss and degradation of its forest habitat. Currently this rate of decline does not approach the thresholds for listing as threatened, but this should continue to be closely monitored, with forests on Sulawesi increasingly under pressure from settlements and large-scale logging operations. Presently, the species is considered Least Concern.<p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "Forest loss, degradation and fragmentation are considered the main threats to this species. In the 15 years to 2022, forest cover in the species' range declined by <em>c</em>.10% (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). The rate of forest loss appears to be increasing (Voigt <em>et al</em>. 2021)—the reduction in tree cover over the next three generations is suspected to be <em>c</em>.13%, based on the rate of loss since 2014 (Global Forest Watch 2023). The species appears largely confined to closed-canopy primary forest (Mauro and Drijvers 2000, Eaton <em>et al.</em> 2021), therefore such rates of deforestation are suspected to be driving declines of 10-19% over three generations.",

The latter is assumed to be present in southern <strong>Chad</strong>, and occurs in&#160;<strong>Cameroon</strong>,&#160;<strong>Central African Republic</strong>,&#160;<strong>South Sudan,&#160;</strong>western&#160;<strong>Uganda</strong>&#160;and in Kakamega forest in&#160;Kenya, DR Congo (to Upemba in the south-east and present in the west), and in&#160;<strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong>,&#160;<strong>Republic of the&#160;Congo&#160;</strong>(Congo)<strong>&#160;</strong>and&#160;<strong>Gabon</strong>&#160;south to north-west&#160;Angola&#160;(assumed to be present in Cabinda), south to near Calandula (Fishpool&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021).but is apparently absent from <strong>Rwanda</strong> and <strong>Burundi</strong>.&#160;<em>D. s. occidentalis </em>occurs in Senegal, the Gambia, <strong>Guinea-Bissau</strong>, <strong>Guinea</strong>, <strong>Mali</strong>, <strong>Sierra Leone</strong>, <strong>Liberia</strong>,&#160;<strong>Côte d'Ivoire</strong>, <strong>Burkina Faso</strong>, <strong>Ghana</strong>, <strong>Benin</strong>, <strong>Togo</strong> and Nigeria. It may be present as far east as Lake Chad, and is likely to be found in extreme southern Niger.",
        "population": "It is considered fairly common in a variety of woodland, secondary and primary forest habitats and uses degraded forest and forest patches within agricultural areas. Densities were estimated at 7-8 pairs per square kilometer in Gabon (Brosset and Erard 1986), which would indicate that the global population is very large.&#160;<br/>There are suspected to be at least three subpopulations, but likely fewer than 10. The two subspecies show considerable genetic divergence (Fuchs&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018), and there may be two subclades within the western subspecies divided by the Dahomey Gap (Fuchs&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). The nominate subspecies contains two geographically isolated parts of the range in western Uganda (but these may be contiguous with those in South Sudan and DR Congo) and Kakamega forest in western Kenya (a site where a number of predominately western African species co-occur far to the east of their typical distribution). There may be further division within DR Congo, as it is unclear that the species occupies the whole range south to Upemba (Fishpool&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021). It is suspected that there are at least three and no more than 10 subpopulations.",
        "habitats": "This species is a component of mixed-flocks in a variety of forest and woodland habitat, especially forest edge and patches, secondary and degraded secondary forest, gallery and riverine forest, overgrown gardens and wooded savannahs (Rocamora and Yeatman-Berthelot 2020). It is usually seen singly, in pairs or family groups; it does not congregate. Breeding generally takes place between February and June, with 2-3 eggs laid in a small&#160; nest suspended like a hammock on thin branches (Fry <em>et al. </em>2000). As other drongos it is very vocal.",
        "threats": "The species is tolerant of forest degradation and will use edge and patches of forest, however it does not occur in cleared areas. The conversion of forest land for non-timber crops, large-scale plantations and development of surface mining for minerals are suspected to cause some reduction in abundance within a relatively small scope of the very large range. However it is plausible that other human activity in these sectors that results in the degradation of intact forest may benefit this species to a degree, given its preference for edge and disturbed habitat rather than interior forest. Overall the impact of these threats is suspected to be negligible.",
        "measures": null,
        "use_trade": null,
        "rationale": "This species has a large range that greatly exceeds extent of occurrence thresholds. Within this range it is moderately common to common in a variety of wooded habitats including degraded forest. While not found in open habitats, suitable habitat area remains very large and it is not suspected that the species approaches thresholds for listing as threatened under the range criterion. Despite no formal population estimate existing, densities from one part of the range indicate that the population is large, and does not approach thresholds under criteria relating to population size. Forest cover is declining within its range, but the species' tolerance of degraded areas suggests that any population reduction due to a reduction in forest cover will likely be at a rate below that of forest cover loss, which itself is occurring at a slow to moderate rate across the range. As such the population trend is considered unknown. The species extinction risk has not been formally quantified using a modelling approach.&#160;Sharpe's Drongo is accordingly assessed as Least Concern.",
        "trend_justification": "The area of forest cover within the range of the species is undergoing a moderately rapid reduction (7.1% forest cover loss [data from Global Forest Watch 2023]) over 3-generations. However, the species is tolerant of degraded forest and while it requires some wooded habitats, it favours edge and patchy habitats whose availability may have increased over this same time period. Consequently the impact of the current rate of forest cover loss on the population is unclear and the population trend is considered unknown.",
        "taxonomic_notes": "<em>Dicrurus ludwigii</em> and <em>D. sharpei</em> were previously lumped as <em>D. ludwigii</em> (Handbook of the Birds of the World and BirdLife International 2022) but split following Fuchs <em>et al. </em>(2017, 2018) and Fishpool <em>et al.</em> (2021), who showed that <em>sharpei </em>is genetically diverged from <em>ludwigii </em>and that it differs morphologically in a number of ways, such as blue vs green sheen in both sexes (1); all-dark vs white-tipped underwing-coverts in both sexes (sometimes reported inversely, in error) (1); female as glossy as male vs less glossy than male (1); female close in size to male vs perceptibly smaller (on wing length at least 1); and almost squared-off vs more obviously forked tail in both sexes (1), as well as vocally. Suggestions that the recently described taxon <em>occidentalis </em>from W of the R Niger (Fuchs <em>et al. </em>2018) might form a third species in the complex were rejected by Fishpool <em>et al.</em> (2021), who suggested that it is better treated as a subspecies of <em>sharpei</em>. Two subspecies recognised."

        "range": "This species occurs in the rugged interior of Rarotonga, <strong>Cook Islands</strong>.&#160;<p></p>",
        "population": "The population was estimated at 2,350 mature individuals in 2010 (based on distance sampling in nine inland valleys, density averaging at 0.5 per hectare), and it is reported to be relatively localised and not evenly distributed (Easby 2011,&#160;Easby and Compton 2013, Thibault and Cibois 2017).",
        "habitats": "This is a shy and inconspicuous inhabitant of undisturbed, native montane forest and fringing disturbed forest<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pratt <em>et al</em>. 1987)<strong></strong> from 150-200 m up to the highest areas of the island at 600 m (Holyoak and Thibault 1984)<strong></strong>. Although a recent survey indicated that they also frequent areas as low as 30 m (A. Tiraa <em>in litt. </em>2003)<strong><sup> </sup></strong> they no longer seem to frequent coastal areas as much as they did in the past (A. Tiraa <em>in litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. It is found either alone or in pairs, foraging in the canopy (Pratt <em>et al</em>. 1987)<strong></strong> and appears to have a varied diet, feeding on nectar, fruit and insects (Holyoak and Thibault 1984)<strong></strong>. A nest has been observed in the cavity of an old tree (Holyoak and Thibault 1984)<strong></strong>, and birds seem to prefer to nest in native trees such as koka <em>Bischofia javanica</em>, mato <em>Homalium acuminatum</em> and turina <em>Hernandia moerenhoutiana</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong>(A. Tiraa <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Surveys have reported that valleys of low starling abundance have high proportions of hibiscus <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hibiscus tiliaceus</span> and lack suitable vegetation for food and nesting, such as the Rarotonga fitchia <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fitchia speciosa</span> and Polynesian chestnut <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Inocarpus fagifer</span> (Easby 2011,&#160;Easby and Compton 2013). This species lays more than one egg per clutch, uses the same nest in subsequent years, breeds between August and December and holds territories (A. Tiraa <em>in litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>.<br/><p></p>",
        "threats": "Previously found throughout Rarotonga, but lower altitude areas have largely been converted to agriculture, human habitation or scrub (Easby and Compton 2013). The introduced Common Myna <em>Acridotheres tristis</em> is aggressive and widespread and is often blamed for the demise of the native landbirds (McCormack 1997)<strong></strong>. It may be implicated in the loss of this species from the lowlands, but it is not thought to have penetrated the forested uplands (A. Tiraa <em>in litt. </em>2003, G. McCormack <em> in litt </em>2007) and is not currently considered a serious threat (Thibault and Cibois 2017). Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus </em>may reduce nesting success or take incubating birds in the uplands, although overall their effect is likely to be negligible (G. McCormack <em> in litt </em>2023)<strong></strong>. However, densities are highest where rats are controlled (Easby and Compton 2013, Thibault and Cibois 2017). Introduced plant species are increasingly widespread and threaten the remaining areas of native forest favoured by this species, with abundance higher where native forest is less disturbed (Easby and Compton 2013, Thibault and Cibois 2017). The introduction of exotic avian diseases, to which local birds have no immunity, is a possible threat (McCormack 1997)<strong></strong>. Other <em>Aplonis</em> spp. have become extinct or exceedingly rare for unknown reasons (G. Dutson <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong> and so monitoring of the species is required. Cyclones are a plausible future threat that could detrimentally affect the species (H. Robertson <em>in litt.</em> 2023), though the species is relatively secure in upland habitat and has persisted in spite of cyclones historically.&#160;<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species presumably benefits from conservation measures carried out for the Rarotonga Flycatcher <em>Pomarea dimidiata</em>&#160;in the south-east of the island, including intensive rat control.<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Carry out comprehensive surveys to determine current population size and trends. Monitor the species. Investigate possible threats.  Ensure the protection of upland forest.  Control <em>R. rattus </em>and <em>A. tristis </em>in key sites. Control invasive plant species.<p></p>",
        "use_trade": null,
        "rationale": "This species has a very restricted range where habitat degradation is ongoing. It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.<br/><p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "The population trend has not been assessed directly. The species seems to have declined in the lowlands in the 1970s possibly owing to aggressive competition from the introduced Common Myna&#160;<em>Acridotheres tristis, </em>however this is not currently considered to be a serious threat (Thibault and Cibois 2017). The species remains abundant in suitable habitat and there is no evidence for substantial declines (Easby and Compton 2013, Thibault and Cibois 2017, G. McCormack <em>in litt.</em> 2023). As such, the species is tentatively suspected to be stable overall, but up-to-date surveys are urgently required.",

        "population": "The naturally occurring population on Nihoa was estimated at 489 &#160;± 70 (SD) in 2010, 699&#160;± 78 in 2011, 610&#160;± 210 in 2012, 468&#160;± 166 in 2013, and 893&#160;± 303 in 2014 (Gorresen <em>et al.</em> 2016). The most recent estimate of the population on Laysan was 164 in September 2014 (Dalton <em>et al.</em> 2014, Freifeld <em>et al. </em>2016). Given that the Nihoa subpopulation is thought to fluctuate widely, the population is tentatively placed in the band 250-999 mature individuals. This estimate equates to 375-1,499 individuals in total, rounded here to 350-1,500 individuals.",
        "habitats": "It is found in dense cover near the ground, particularly around the shrubs <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sida fallax</span>&#160;and&#160;<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Solanum nelsonii&#160;</span>on Nihoa (VanderWerf <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al. </span>2011, MacDonald 2012), and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Scaevola taccada</span> and the grass&#160;<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Eragrostis variabilis</span> on Laysan (Kohley and Rutt 2012, Wilcox <em>et al.</em> 2013, Dalton <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;The Nihoa Millerbird is relatively evenly distributed across Nihoa, but is slightly more prevalent on upslope (north-ward) (Gorresen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Surveys also indicate a near complete use of available habitat during 2010 to 2014 (Gorresen <em>et al.</em> 2016). On Nihoa the main foods include small beetles, spiders, roaches and larvae (Morin <em>et al.</em> 1997, MacDonald 2012). The original, naturally occurring Laysan population was thought to have fed primarily on moths (Henshaw 1902), however, the species is thought to be a catholic feeder, feeding on the most readily available arthropod prey items (MacDonald 2012).&#160;Pairs show year-to-year fidelity in specific territories, with nesting apparently correlated with precipitation and most breeding taking place in the winter months (peaking January-March), although the breeding period may be extended in years of high summer rainfall (MacDonald 2012). The translocated population on Laysan breeds from at least February through September, with a peak in spring-summer months (Wilcox <em>et al.</em> 2013). Nests are located in dense shrubs or bunchgrass,&#160;<a class=\"msocomanchor\" id=\"_anchor_1\" href=\"#_msocom_1\" name=\"_msoanchor_1\"></a><a>and</a><a class=\"msocomanchor\" id=\"_anchor_2\" href=\"#_msocom_2\" name=\"_msoanchor_2\"></a> two eggs are generally laid (Morin<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> et al.</span> 1997, Wilcox <em>et al.</em> 2013).<p></p>",
        "threats": "The species exhibits extensive and strikingly low levels of genetic  diversity as a result of recent severe bottlenecks (Addison and Diamond 2011). These may have been caused by  climatic events, anthropogenic influences (impacts of Nihoa's prehistoric human population, and perhaps of modern introduction of nonnative plants and insects) or other stochastic fluctuations in habitat and consequently in population size. The Millerbird's extinction on Laysan in the early 20th century was ultimately caused by the introduction of rabbits and livestock, which denuded the island of vegetation (severe declines in the species' invertebrate prey and suitable habitat). On Nihoa, the population size is probably regulated primarily by precipitation levels, which affect the abundance of arthropod prey (extended droughts for example, are likely to have a negative impact). Hurricanes may be an increasing threat to this species as a result of climate change (USFWS 2017). Severe weather events may cause direct mortality of Millerbirds; a single severe storm could extinguish an entire subpopulation (USFWS 2010)<strong></strong>.&#160;Climate models indicate that hurricanes in the northwestern Pacific are expected to increase in intensity (5.4%), frequency (2.8%) and duration (1.4%) by 2100 (Emanuel <em>et al.</em> 2008). The Laysan population is likely to become more vulnerable than the Nihoa population based on dynamic wave-driven inundation projections (Gorresen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). A recent modelling study of passive sea-level rise (SLR) showed that approximately 4 percent of the total land areas in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands will be lost with +1.0 m of SLR and 26 percent will be lost with +2.0 m SLR (Reynolds&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). For Laysan Island this was predicted to be 7 percent at 1.0 m SLR and 24 percent at +2.0 SLR (Reynolds&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). However,&#160;thus far the subpopulations have survived severe weather without apparent long-term effects (C. Farmer <em>in litt.</em> 2022). Drought is likely to be exacerbated by climate change and this may be causing declines (R. Rounds <em>in litt</em> 2022). Since  the species has an extremely  small range and severely low levels  of genetic diversity, it is also particularly vulnerable to extinction  through exposure to disease and the introduction of invasive species. Population outbreaks of the non-native grasshoppers (e.g. the Gray Bird Grasshopper<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> </span><em>Schistocerca nitens</em>) have periodically denuded  90% of the island's vegetated area, especially the shrubs in which  Millerbirds nest. Outbreaks such as these may have been responsible for  reductions in the  bird population to well below 200 individuals in  1994, 1996, and 2005 (<a class=\"ref\">Latchininsky 2008</a>). Habitat degradation is also caused by invasive plant species such as sandbur <em>Cenchrus echinatus</em>. Fire is a past and potential threat (Morin <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong> and introduction of detrimental non-native species, especially predators such as rats (<em>Rattus spp.</em>) is a permanent possibility. Yellow crazy ants<em>&#160;Anoplolepis gracilipes</em>&#160;may pose an additional threat given that the species are present at the Hawaii base yard where packing for trips to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands occurs (USFWS 2017). Nihoa and Laysan Finches (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Telespiza ultima </span>and<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> T. cantans,</span> respectively)<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">&#160;</span>may prey upon the eggs of Millerbirds, but since these species evolved together, it is unlikely to present a significant threat (M.A. MacDonald <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt. </span>2008).&#160;Avian diseases (West Nile virus and avian influenza) also pose a risk if introduced to the islands (USFWS 2017).",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>Nihoa is part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (H. Freifeld <em>in litt.</em> 2010).  Legal access is controlled by a permit system that restricts access to biologists, other researchers, and native Hawaiian cultural practitioners. Strict biosecurity protocols are followed to ensure that legal visitors do not accidentally introduce new species via seeds, eggs or arthropods travelling on clothes and equipment. Visiting scientists make efforts to control alien plants by hand pulling and other methods (e.g. Plentovich<em> et al.</em> 2014).&#160;A scoping document for translocations was produced in 2007, identifying Laysan, Kure and Lisianski as the most suitable islands on the basis of island size, elevation and a lack of predators (Morin and Conant 2007). Development of detailed translocation, release, and monitoring methods were finalized in 2011 (Farmer<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> et al. </span>2011) and two successful translocations to Laysan in 2011 and 2012 resulted in a nascent population there, last estimated at 164 birds (Freifeld<em> et al. </em>2016). The population will continue to be monitored and the data used to determine population persistence and growth. New, more rigorous population monitoring methods were introduced on Nihoa in recent years (Gorresen <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gorresen <em>et al. </em>2016); these are expected to yield estimates of total numbers with improved confidence and, if monitoring is done annually, early detection of significant trends.&#160;<br/><br/><p></p><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Continue monitoring millerbirds on Nihoa and Laysan. Monitoring on Laysan is particularly important to document vital rates, dispersal, and habitat use, and the role of these in population persistence. Continued study of the reintroduced population on Laysan is essential to inform conservation translocations of this and other Hawaiian passerines in the future. However, monitoring and study on Laysan has become far more challenging since the closure of the long-term, year-round USFWS field camp on the island in 2013. Continue to refine survey protocols for estimating Nihoa Millerbird population sizes and trends that minimise impacts to other resident species (USFWS 2017).&#160;Long-term research that does not impact the islands negatively is needed to study the species ecology (USFWS 2017). Continue to monitor Nihoa for the highly invasive plant <em>Cenchrous echinatus </em>that was re-discovered in September 2011, and continue to monitor and manage invasive alien plants on Laysan (e.g., Morin and Conant 1998). Ensure strict adherence to quarantine protocols to prevent further accidental introductions of alien species. Carry out additional translocations to establish populations on other islands as appropriate (S. Conant <em>in litt. </em>2008, Freifeld<em> et al. </em>2016).<p></p>",
        "use_trade": null,
        "rationale": "This species has a very restricted range on the islands of Nihoa and Laysan, where habitat degradation is ongoing. These populations are at risk of extinction through exposure to stochastic factors such as severe climatic events or the introduction of invasive species. It is therefore assessed as Endangered.<br/><p></p> <p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "Although there is a lack of precision over the monitoring methods, the existing data suggest that Millerbird numbers on Nihoa have experienced pronounced fluctuations and have likely ranged between fewer than 50 and more than 800 individuals (VanderWerf&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).&#160;Although it is still thought to undergo substantial fluctuations, the species may not currently be as at risk as in the late 1980s (Gorresen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Numbers on Laysan have greatly increased since translocations in 2011 and 2012 (C. Farmer<em> in litt. </em>2022). In 2016, population trends were considered inconclusive on Nihoa due to high within-year variance (Gorresen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Although an updated population estimate is not currently available (C. Farmer <em>in litt. </em>2022), raw detections per effort on Nihoa in 2010-2021 are not indicative of a decline overall (Plentovich <em>et al.</em> 2021). However, detections were reportedly very low in 2022 (R. Rounds <em>in litt. </em>2022). This may be due to several different reasons including the time of year, however severe drought driven by climate change may be a contributing factor (R. Rounds <em>in litt.</em> 2022, S. Plentovich<em> in litt.</em> 2022). It is currently unclear whether this is a natural fluctuation or if dry conditions from 2022 are indicative of longer-term trends (J. Vetter<em> in litt. </em>2022), and as such, the population trend is precautionarily considered to be unknown overall.<p></p>",

The population trend is thought to be stable and hence it does not meet or approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size has not been quantified and the species therefore does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure).

        "range": "<em>Prosopeia splendens</em> is endemic to <strong>Fiji</strong> where it occurs naturally on the islands of Kadavu and Ono, and has been reported to be widespread and common on the former (G. Dutson pers. obs. 2000, J. S. Kretzschmar<em> in litt</em>. 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The birds on Ono island are believed to be the same subpopulation as on the nearby main island of Kadavu. Reports of breeding on other islands need to be confirmed and are likely to originate from long-lived escaped cage-birds (D. Watling verbally 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;<p></p>",
        "population": "The population size has not been directly estimated, however the species is described as widespread and common on Kadavu (Collar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Given that the species appears to occur at similar population densities to the Masked Shining-parrot (<em>Prosopeia personata</em>)&#160;(86 Crimson Shining-parrots were recorded in 38 standardised observer-hours on two surveys, similar to the mean of 1.9 Masked Shining-parrots per hour recorded at 18 sites across Viti Levu), the population has been inferred to number 6,000 birds or 4,000 mature individuals&#160;(Jackson and Jit 2004) and is placed in the range 3,000-5,000, although this is highly uncertain (USFWS 2011).",
        "habitats": "It is found in forest, mangrove, agricultural lands and around human habitation both in the lowlands and hills<strong> </strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998, Watling 2001). It is assumed to be a hole-nester like <em>P. tabuensis </em>(Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. The species is not restricted to  the forest during breeding  (D. Watling verbally 2000), as nests have been found in trees in the centre of the villages (M. Tabudravu <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012). Pairs and small flocks forage widely for fruit and seeds, both in the forest canopy and in agricultural gardens (G. Dutson pers. obs. 2000)<strong></strong>. <p></p>",
        "threats": "Forest on Kadavu was heavily logged in the late 1960s and early 1970s and habitat loss and degradation for agricultural purposes continues, though 75% of the island remains forested&#160;&#160;(Watling 2000, V. Masibalavu&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007<strong></strong>). The species also uses degraded habitats&#160;such that although forest loss may affect the species, it may not be driving significant declines. Forest loss is slow but ongoing within the range (c.4-5% over three generations [Global Forest Watch 2022, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] and methods disclosed therein]).&#160;The growing human population on Kadavu and degradation of agricultural areas are increasing pressure to clear more forest (Conservational International Pacific Islands Program 2013).&#160;Forest fires are an additional threat (G. Dutson <em>in litt.</em> 2005), although conservation actions targeting forest fires have improved (M. Tabudravu <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt. </span>2012). Most river estuaries and bays still hold large areas of mangroves which are intensively used by <em>P. splendens</em> for feeding (and perhaps breeding), although pressure on mangrove forest is not significant at present (J. S. Kretzschmar<em> in litt</em>. 2000, D. Watling <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. It reportedly captured in small numbers, with birds being taken as gifts by islanders returning to the capital, Suva (Watling 2000)<strong></strong>, and there may be at least some illegal trade overseas (J. S. Kretzschmar<em> in litt</em>. 2000), although this is not considered to be a significant threat to the species (USFWS 2011).<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. It is protected under Fijian law, which has recently been revised, the old Birds &amp; Game Act has in part been surpassed by the Endangered Species Protection Act which does provide it with protection (SPREP 2000, D. Watling <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Conservation projects have reduced trade in this species (Jackson and Jit 2004)<strong></strong>. Four communities have set up a community declared protected area covering 1,535 hectares of forest and local volunteers monitor bird populations and assess habitat status under their own initiative (V. Masibalavu <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2007). Conservation actions targeting fire prevention (particularly awareness-raising following the change in decree relating to fire offences) have improved (V. Masibalavu <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012, M. Tabudravu <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012).<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Determine population densities in various habitats. Research breeding requirements and success. Monitor numbers trapped and transported to Suva. Promote the creation of community-based forest reserves. Set standards for the keeping of parrots in captivity to reduce demand (SPREP 2000)<strong></strong>. Use the species as a figurehead to promote ecotourism in Kadavu. <p></p>",

        "rationale": "This species has a very restricted range, where habitat loss and degradation are ongoing. It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.<p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "The population trend has not been quantified. Forest loss is occurring at a rate equivalent to 4-5% over three generations (Global Forest Watch 2022, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] and methods disclosed therein) and appears to have accelerated based on losses in 2017-2021. However, the species is not restricted to primary forest and occurs in degraded habitat (Juniper and Parr 1998, Watling 2001). As such, although forest loss may affect the species, it&#160;may not be causing substantial declines overall. Birds are reportedly captured in small numbers and there may be some illegal trade overseas (Watling 2000, J. S. Kretzschmar<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2000), though this is not currently thought to be a significant threat to the species (USFWS 2011). Overall, the population trend is considered to be unknown.",

        "range": "<em>Pluvianellus socialis</em> occurs in extreme south <strong>Chile </strong>and south and south-east <strong>Argentina</strong>. It breeds in Patagonia. Part of the population migrates north during the non-breeding season along the Atlantic coast to the Valdés peninsula and Buenos Aires province, with single individuals being recorded in Uruguay and the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (Pearman and Areta 2020, Castelli <em>et al</em>. 2022).<br/><em> </em><em></em>",
        "population": "The species appears to be rare and not abundant. A thorough census of 180 sites carried out in December 2021 over the breeding range detected 264 mature individuals (Imberti and Matus 2023, Imberti <em>et al</em>. 2023). Considering that this census surveyed c.80% of the breeding range, the total population is best estimated at 330 mature individuals. These values were somewhat confirmed by a subsequent count of 65 sites in the non-breeding range during May 2022, which detected 300 individuals, among them 55 juveniles (Imberti and Matus 2023, Imberti <em>et al</em>. 2023).<br/>To account for uncertainty and imperfect detectability, the population is here tentatively placed in the band 250-999 mature individuals, with a best estimate of 330 mature individuals.",
        "habitats": "It breeds on the open shores of freshwater or brackish lakes, shallow pools and sometimes rivers, in steppe-like regions up to 1,200 m. Nests are placed on pebbled or unvegetated beaches near the shore (Lishman and Nol 2012, Wiersma and Kirwan 2020). The species is partially migratory, with some individuals moving northward along the Atlantic coast during the non-breeding season (Wiersma and Kirwan 2020). Outside the breeding season, it occurs along rivers<strong> </strong>and on the coast, mostly in sheltered bays, lagoons and river mouths <strong></strong>(Imberti 2003, Wiersma and Kirwan 2020). It feeds primarily on tiny arthropods during the breeding season, with chironomid larvae apparently forming the staple food in winter, when it forages in small flocks<strong></strong> (Piersma 1996). <p></p>",
        "threats": "There are few apparent reasons for its scarcity. The destruction and degradation of natural grassland in Patagonia by grazing sheep is contributing to a degradation of breeding habitat, with water bodies used as troughs for livestock (Manomet, CRAL and Asociación Ambiente Sur 2023). Nests are destroyed through trampling of grazing animals (Manomet, CRAL and Asociación Ambiente Sur 2023). Shallow lagoons suitable for breeding have disappeared in the past,  though it is unclear whether this is a consequence of grazing and  anthropogenic alterations of the landscape, or whether this is due to  natural cycles (R. Matus <em>in litt</em>. 2023). Further threats include predation and disturbance by feral dogs (Manomet, CRAL and Asociación Ambiente Sur 2023). It may be vulnerable to urbanisation and increasing human disturbance through recreational activities in dune habitat, accompanied by the degradation of estuarine habitat due to oil spills, garbage dumping and sewage<strong> </strong>(Ferrari <em>et al. </em>2003, Manomet, CRAL and Asociación Ambiente Sur 2023, J. Veiga<em> in litt</em>. 2023). Lower annual rainfall and desertification as a consequence of climate change could negatively affect reproductive output (Manomet, CRAL and Asociación Ambiente Sur 2023). Furthermore, the construction of windfarms within the range could disturb or disrupt migratory routes (Manomet, CRAL and Asociación Ambiente Sur 2023). Ultimately however, there is little to no evidence that any of these threats are causing significant declines.<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is listed as Endangered at the national level in Argentina (MAyDS and AA 2017). In Argentina, it breeds in Tierra del Fuego and Perito Moreno National Parks, and Bosques Petrificados Natural Monument, and it is also found in Magallanes and Laguna de los Cisnes National Reserves, Chile. <p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Systematically survey known sites and search for the species in potentially suitable habitat. Study the species' ecology. Research threats and their likely impacts on the population size. Develop and action plan to protect the species and its habitat. Carefully monitor the population trend. Increase protection at key breeding and wintering sites. Raise awareness for the species and its habitat with the aim of reducing disturbance to key sites.<br/><p></p>",

        "rationale": "This species appears to be naturally rare; recent surveys found that the global population is small and likely numbers just 330 mature individuals. The population trend however is thought to be stable. It is therefore assessed as Vulnerable.<br/><p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "The population trend has not been investigated. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the species is genuinely rare (J. Veiga <em>in litt</em>. 2023) and that previous estimates of 1,500-7,000 mature individuals may have been overly optimistic (Imberti and Matus 2023). Visits to a number of known sites over nearly 30 years indicate that the populations there are overall stable, despite some short-term fluctuations in numbers (Imberti and Matus 2023, Imberti <em>et al</em>. 2023). In the absence of evidence for any declines, the population is currently suspected to be stable, albeit at low numbers.",

It has presumably increased in the past to populate large forestry plantations (G.&#160;Dutson pers. obs. 1997, M.&#160;Iles verbally 1998).&#160;Consequently, there is no reason to suspect declines in response to forest loss.

Formerly, it was also absent from Lâna`i, which, along with Kaho`olawe, lacked suitable wetland habitat (USFWS 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

        "population": "The population is thought to vary year-to-year in response to rainfall, with periodic fluctuations to below 1,500 mature individuals. The most recent minimum population estimate is 1,815 (1,248– 2,577) individuals, based on a 5-year average (2012–2016) of biannual waterbird census counts (Paxton <em>et al.</em> 2021). Assuming that summer counts reflect the best metric of mature individuals, the population size is here estimated at 1,250-1,750 mature individuals (based on Figure 1 in van Rees&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2022]), with&#160;Kaua'i, O'ahu and Maui likely supporting 80% of this total.",
        "habitats": "It can be expected on virtually any body of water, including estuaries, marshes and golf course wetlands (M. Reed <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is typically a species of the coastal plain, usually found below 400 m, however some birds inhabit upland pools above 1,500 m on Kaua'i and montane stock ponds up to 2,000 m on Hawai'i (USFWS 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Breeding sites are characterised by robust emergent plants interspersed with open, fresh or brackish water, which is usually less than one metre deep. To some extent it is nomadic and irruptive, wandering between islands in response to the availability of water-bodies (Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It may nest in any month of the year (USFWS 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>",
        "threats": "Ongoing threats to this species include predation, degradation of wetlands, and avian disease (USFWS 2021). <br/>Throughout its range, wetlands have been destroyed by drainage for cultivation and developments (Berger 1972, <strong></strong>P. Donaldson <em>in litt.</em> 1999, S. L. Pimm <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong> such as hotels, housing areas, golf courses, shopping centres, landfill sites, military installations, roads and industrial sites (USFWS 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Some water-bodies have become overgrown by introduced plants (H. C. Baker and P. E. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, M. Morin <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. On O'ahu, artificial wetlands associated with sugarcane plantations have disappeared as these industries have declined on the island (P. Donaldson <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Wetlands continue to be threatened with urban development and invasive plant species, though surveys suggest the population size overall has not been affected detrimentally (Paxton <em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;<br/>Introduced predators&#160;include the Black Rat <em>Rattus rattus</em>, Brown Rat <em>Rattus norwegicus</em>, domestic cat <em>Felis catus</em> and dog <em>Canis familiaris</em>, Small Indian Mongoose <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>&#160;and Cattle Egret<em> Bubulcus ibis</em><strong> </strong>(Engilis and Pratt 1993, H. C. Baker and P. E. Baker&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999, M. Reed <em>in litt.</em> 2007). <em>H. auropunctatus</em>&#160;is known to take the eggs, young birds and nesting adults of wetland bird species (USFWS 2005)<strong></strong>. Predation appears to be a serious problem on golf courses, where<em> F. alai</em> is abundant (M. Reed <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. <br/>The species may be poisoned by insecticides and herbicides used to treat water channels on agricultural land and golf courses (Berger 1972, P. Donaldson <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, although research is required to confirm this potential threat and its severity. Outbreaks of avian botulism have caused high mortality in several areas (Morin 1996, H. C. Baker and P. E. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, M. Morin <em>in litt.</em> 1999, E. VanderWerf <em>in litt.</em> 2007), a threat that&#160;may increase with climate change, increasing urbanisation and invasive aquatic species (USFWS 2021). Changes in precipitation due to climate change, as well as threats of flooding and saltwater intrusion, are thought to be causing degradation of wetland habitat (Timm <em>et al.</em> 2015).",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Hunting was prohibited in 1939, and the species has been fully protected by US law since 1970. Several key wetland areas have been acquired as refuges or sanctuaries, and other areas are protected by cooperative agreements. Predator control measures and restoration efforts are in place for some wetlands (USFWS 2021). There is partial monitoring of wetland areas and removal of carcasses for botulism outbreaks (USFWS 2021). The species is considered conservation reliant, with cessation of management likely to result in declines (van Rees <em>et al.</em> 2022).<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Determine the relative importance of threats (M. Reed <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Investigate whether herbicides and insecticides used on golf courses pose a serious threat to the species. Continue to monitor for avian botulism (USFWS 2021). Develop new tools to prevent botulism-related mortality (USFWS 2021). Continue annual state-wide waterbird counts (USFWS 2021). <br/>Increase the area of protected wetlands (M. Reed <em>in litt.</em> 2007, USFWS 2021)<strong></strong>. Manage habitats, e.g. prevent ponds from drying out, or becoming overgrown by alien plants and create nesting islands inaccessible to introduced predators (Byrd <em>et al.</em> 1985, Engilis and Pratt 1993)<strong></strong>. Improve altered wetland hydrology as appropriate (USFWS 2021). Continue and expand predator control, and remove invasive plants (USFWS 2021).

        "range": "This species is restricted to the island of Hawaii in the&#160;Hawaiian islands&#160;(<strong>U.S.A.</strong>), where it was abundant, although locally distributed, until the beginning of the 20th century; evidence from the fossil record suggests that the species occurred throughout the archipelago prior to human settlement (Olson and James 1982, Burney <em>et al.</em> 2001). In 1997, it occupied an estimated 78 km<sup>2</sup> and numbered 4,396 individuals,<strong><sup> </sup></strong> mostly on the western slope of Mauna Kea, where 20.5 km<sup>2</sup> was estimated to hold 72% of the total population (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, Fancy <em>et al.</em> 1997, Banko <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. The species' range remains centred on the western slope, and it has contracted such that c.96% of the population is found in 4,600 ha of forest (R. Camp&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2014)<strong></strong>. It has not been found in annual surveys on the east slope since 2004 (P. Banko <em>in litt.</em> 2007, C. Farmer <em>in litt.</em> 2007, R. Camp <em>in litt</em>. 2014, 2016)<strong></strong>. A small colony of reintroduced individuals has been extirpated on the northern slope (Banko <em>et al. </em>2014a)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>",
        "population": "In 2021 the population was estimated at 452−940 individuals (point estimate of 678), with previous estimates of 1,030−1,899 individuals (point estimate of 1,432) in 2019, and 964−1,700 individuals (point estimate of 1,312) in 2020 (Genz <em>et al.</em> 2022). Although 2021 abundance estimates are approximately 50% of 2020 estimates, this is considered biologically unlikely and previous low estimates from annual surveys in 2000, 2010 and 2015 have been immediately followed by an increase in subsequent years (Genz <em>et al.</em> 2022). The five-year average (2017-2021) population size is 1,128&#160;individuals, and based on an approximate estimate that 86% are mature individuals (C. Farmer <em>in litt.</em> 2016) this equates to 970 mature individuals. The population size is therefore tentatively placed in the range 800-1,200 mature individuals.",
        "habitats": "It is confined to altitudes of c. 2,000-3,000 m, favouring dry māmane and māmane-naio forest. It feeds primarily on māmane seeds, flowers, and insects (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2002, Banko and Farmer 2014, Hess <em>et al.</em> 2014), with the availability of māmane seeds affecting productivity and adult survival. The species is morphologically and behaviourally adapted to feeding on māmane seeds, grasping pods with its feet and using its stout bill to tear them open. In drought years, most birds do not attempt to breed (Jacobi <em>et al.</em> 1996, <strong></strong>Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. The species exhibits low rates of reproduction (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2002, Banko and Farmer 2012),&#160;laying fewer eggs and taking longer to raise its young compared with mainland songbirds (Hess and Banko 2006)<strong></strong>.<p></p>",
        "threats": "The most significant declines in this species' range and population are thought to have been caused by human-induced habitat loss and degradation and impacts from feral and domestic ungulates (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2002, Banko and Farmer 2014, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b). Māmane forest is slow to recover and young māmane requires about 25 years of growth before the species frequent them for foraging and nesting (P. Banko <em>in litt.</em> 2023).&#160;<br/>The subalpine forest habitat of this species has been severely overbrowsed by sheep, mouflon sheep, goats, cattle,&#160;and its nests and adults are preyed upon primarily by feral cats <em>Felis catus</em>, but also by introduced Black Rats <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Rattus rattus</span>, Short-eared Owl <em>Asio flammeus</em>, and rarely Hawaiian Hawk <em>Buteo solitarius</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> </span>(Banko <em>et al.</em> 2002, Banko and Farmer 2014)<strong></strong>. Up to 11% of nests are depredated by feral cats each year (Hess and Banko 2006)<strong></strong>. Grazing by cattle was a historical factor in the species' decline, although cattle are now limited to pastures that are unsuitable for <em>L. bailleui </em>(C. Farmer <em>in litt.</em> 2007, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b)<strong></strong>. Continuing threats include grazing by feral sheep, wild sheep <em>Ovis gmelini</em>, and their hybrids, which slows māmane regeneration (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1997, Banko and Farmer 2012, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2013, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b), and alien insects preying on and parasitising native insects (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1997, Banko and Farmer 2012)<strong></strong>, particularly at low elevations (Banko and Farmer 2012)<strong></strong>. Native caterpillars are an important source of protein for nestlings,  and possibly breeding females; however, they are preyed upon by  Yellow-jacket Wasps&#160;and several ant species, particularly Argentine Ants  <em>Linepithema humile</em>, whilst parasitoid wasps kill the caterpillars by laying their eggs on or inside them (Banko and Farmer 2012)<strong></strong>. Damage of <em>Myoporum sandwichense</em>&#160;tress from Naio thrips <em>Klambothrips myopori </em>may lead to increased tree death and increased fire risk (USFWS 2020). Alien grass cover such as African Fountain Grass <em>Cenchrus setaceus</em> and Orchard Grass&#160;<em>Dactylis glomerata</em><em>&#160;</em>is high in much of the species' range (Banko and Farmer 2014)<strong></strong>,  suppressing māmane regeneration and increasing the threat of fire (Thaxton and Jacobi 2009).&#160;Alien shrubs and vines potentially displace māmane and other native plants; e.g., Cape Ivy <em>Delairea odorata</em>&#160;and Common Gorse <em>Ulex europaeus</em> (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2020). Root rot caused by the non-native fungus&#160;<em>Armillaria mellea&#160;</em>is also responsible for&#160;dieback occurring in māmane forests (Banko <em>et al. </em>2014b).&#160;<br/>Increasing human activities, such as military training, further increase the chances of fire (Thaxton and Jacobi 2009)<strong></strong>. In 2006-2007, there were numerous fires on and near Mauna Kea, and fires in August and September 2010 affected c.560 ha of suitable habitat  on the southern slope of the mountain (American Bird Conservancy 2010, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b)<strong></strong>. A fire in the species' core area could potentially affect &gt;90% of the population (C. Farmer<em> in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. The opening of trails for all-terrain vehicles in the Mauna Kea Forest Reserve is a concern (C. Farmer <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>, and may cause disturbance and habitat degradation. <br/>In addition to the aforementioned threats, this species' very restricted range means it could be extirpated by extreme events such as drought and storms (Banko and Farmer 2012)<strong></strong>, and drought has contributed to declines given its high dependence on the unripened māmane seeds (Lindsey<em> et al. </em>1997, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2013)<strong></strong>. Drought conditions on Mauna Kea occurred during 74 percent of the months from 2000 to 2010, recorded in all but two months from 2006 to 2010 (Banko<em> et al. </em>2013). This leads to reduced māmane seed production, increased tree death and increased fire risk (VanderWerf 2012, USFWS 2020). Further declines in breeding success are expected in line with drought induced by El Niño, conditions of which are present as of 2023 and expected to increase (P. Banko <em>in litt. </em>2023). This species' low reproductive capacity means it is slow to recover from perturbations. Demographic patterns of māmane mortality are under investigation, as māmane may be under threat from pathogens (USFWS 2006, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b)<strong></strong>. <br/>Climate change poses a long-term future threat to the species, as drought frequency and intensity are expected to increase at higher elevations, further affecting vegetation structure and compositions, and reducing the&#160;habitat's carrying capacity&#160;(Benning <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 2002, Giambelluca and Luke 2007, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2013). Given that this species occurs primarily at elevations where mosquitoes are absent, it is thought to be more limited by habitat availability than by avian disease (Kilpatrick 2006).&#160;However, avian malaria and avian pox have significantly affected other forest birds and are likely to prevent the species re-establishing in areas of its former range (Jacobi <em>et al.</em> 1996). Additionally, climate change is projected to cause an increase in the elevation below which regular transmission of avian malaria occurs, reducing the area of suitable habitat and exacerbating existing declines (USFWS 2020). According to climate projections, due to increased rainfall and temperatures, high elevation areas for Hawaiian bird populations will only remain free of mosquitos to mid-century (Liao&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) and GIS simulation has shown that a 2 degrees Celsius increase would cause a c.100% decline in the land area where transmission is currently only periodic (Benning<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2002). Palila are highly sensitive to the disease and if the transmission zone rises sufficiently it is entirely plausible that the entire species would be affected by malaria (C. Farmer <em>in litt.</em> 2016, 2023).",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species' population has been monitored since 1980 (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, Leonard <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camp <em>et al</em>. 2016). Annual surveys are conducted to monitor range and abundance (USFWS 2020).&#160;In 1979, 1987 and 1998, federal courts ordered the eradication of feral goats and feral and wild sheep species from the species' habitat on Mauna Kea, and these rulings have remained in effect despite six legal challenges (Banko <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 2009, 2014b). Forest regeneration has improved as a result, although current efforts to reduce sheep have not been sufficient to allow the complete recovery of māmane&#160;forests (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b). Palila have some site fidelity, but have also been detected moving around Mauna Kea into new forested areas (Banko and Farmer 2014). In 1993, some birds were translocated to a new site on the eastern slope where predators were controlled and, although many homed back to their capture site, at least two pairs stayed and bred successfully (Fancy<em> et al</em>. 1997). By the end of 2006, 188 wild birds had been translocated from the western to the northern slope of Mauna Kea (Banko and Farmer 2014). Approximately 34% persisted for longer than two months, and a small colony of up to c.23 birds remained on the northern slope and bred successfully until 2010. Although F2 generation offspring were observed, the colony was not sustainable without additional management (Banko <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 2009, Banko and Farmer 2014) and it was extirpated by 2011 (P. Banko <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012). Egg-laying occurred in 2004, and independent juveniles were produced in every year from 2005-2010 (Banko and Farmer 2014). This translocation programme was aided by a captive breeding programme initiated at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center in 1996 (USFWS 2006, Banko and Farmer 2014). Of 28 captive-reared birds released in 2003-2009, at least 10 persisted in the reintroduction area for at least one year, with 2 males successfully producing fledglings with translocated wild females in the north slope colony before its extirpation (Banko and Farmer 2014). Results suggest that, although some translocated birds nest successfully and others remain in the new area for over a year, eventually all birds return to the source area (western slope) (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;Eight captive birds were released at the Puʻu Mali Restoration Area on the north slope of Mauna Kea in 2019 (USFWS 2020). After being temporarily held in release aviaries, individuals dispersed widely but most died from predation or disappeared within one week (USFWS 2020). A captive population is&#160; maintained by San Diego Zoo Global (USFWS 2020).<br/>The construction of a highway through unoccupied, federally designated critical habitat was approved in 1999. A mitigation plan accompanied the development, including the suspension of cattle grazing in pastures adjacent to the species' range on the northern and western slopes. The species' conservation&#160;was the subject of detailed research, and funding from the mitigation plan supported translocation research and enabled the expansion or continuation of studies into the species' ecology and limiting factors,&#160;māmane&#160;ecology, food availability, predator ecology and management, and fire ecology (Banko and Farmer 2014). The state of Hawaii continues&#160;habitat restoration and research into restoration methods (Banko and Farmer 2014). Work is being carried out to restore habitat by controlling African Fountain Grass <em>Pennisetum setaceum</em>, which increases the frequency and intensity of fires, and Cape Ivy <em>Delairea odorata</em>, which reduces the vigour of native trees (American Bird Conservancy 2010).&#160;In 2010, a comprehensive fire management plan was being developed for the Mauna Kea area (Thaxton and Jacobi 2009, American Bird Conservancy 2010). There are currently 100 km of fencing around critical habitat and around the Kaʻohe and Puʻu Mali restoration areas, as well as 26 km of fire breaks in place (USFWS 2020). The Mauna Kea Forest Restoration Project conducts weed control, forest restoration, forest monitoring, fence monitoring and maintenance, community outreach, volunteer trips, and ungulate control at Kaʻohe and Puʻu Mali Restoration Areas and in the core habitat within Mauna Kea Forest Reserve, and predator control is ongoing (USFWS 2020). Research is ongoing to determine survival rates, causes of nest failure, habitat use, dispersal, nest site characteristics, disease prevalence and predator prevalence (USFWS 2020).&#160;<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue population surveys and monitoring to determine response to management actions and the effects of climate change (USFWS 2020). Investigate methods to reduce or control invasive grass cover on Mauna Kea (USFWS 2020). Examine experimental approaches to restore <em>Sophora chrysophylla</em> in heavily degraded areas and improve<em>&#160;</em>tree vigor and density by applying fertilizer, giving water, and/or removing competing weeds in the less affected forest habitats (USFWS 2020). The restoration and protection of mamane in woodlands adjacent to its current range would allow the species to exploit increased food availability in areas of their former range (Hess <em>et al.</em> 2014). Reforest areas adjacent to the Mauna Kea Forest Reserve and areas where alien grasses and grazing threaten māmane&#160;(Pratt <em>et al</em>. 1997).&#160; Continue to restore forest above Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (Benning <em>et al.</em> 2002), including expanding work on Kanakaleonui Bird Corridor. Expand control of invasive introduced plants (USFWS 2020). Remove and fence out ungulates from all critical habitat and the mitigation parcels (Banko&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Banko and Farmer 2014, Banko&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014b, USFWS 2020). Intensify control of mammalian predators (especially feral cats) and grazing ungulates (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1997, H. Baker and P. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, T. Pratt<em> in litt. </em>1999, P. Banko <em>in litt</em>. 2007, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2013, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b, USFWS 2020). Enhance habitat outside the occupied range to aid establishment of new populations (USFWS 2020). Continue to expand the application of translocations and captive propagation for introducing the species to currently unoccupied sites within the former range (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1997, C. Farmer <em>in litt</em>. 2007, Banko and Farmer 2014, USFWS 2020).&#160;Increase public support for Palila conservation and work to resolve conflicts between hunters and local governments. Implement fire risk reduction measures by establishing green fuel breaks and improving existing roadway fire breaks; improve fire detection and response by stationing fire response resources (such as water trucks and fire spotters) on the west slope of Mauna Kea in key habitat; and conduct other improvements where necessary to allow a rapid and effective ground and aerial response to fire (USFWS 2020).&#160;Continue research in the fields of genomic technologies and genetically modified mosquitoes for disease control and their field application (USFWS 2020)<p></p>",

        "rationale": "<p>This species has an extremely small range and population size, restricted to a single subpopulation on the southwestern slope of Mauna Kea where its survival is tightly linked to the availability of māmane&#160;seed pods. Annual transect surveys indicate that the species is declining at a rate exceeding 50% in three generations, driven primarily by prolonged drought and habitat degradation by introduced ungulates and invasive plants. The species is restricted to a single location where all individuals present are highly vulnerable to fire. It is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered.</p>  <p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "During 1998−2005, estimates fluctuated between 4,000 and 6,000 individuals, followed by a steep decline - between 2005 and 2008 the population fell from c.5,500 to c.1,800 individuals (Genz <em>et al. </em>2022). This steep decline levelled off somewhat after 2010, but trend assessments show that the population has continued to decline, leading to a record low in 2021 (Genz <em>et al.</em> 2022).&#160;The mean decline during 1998−2021 was 229 individuals per year, resulting in an 89% decline in the population over the entire 23-year monitoring period (Genz<em> et al.</em> 2022), equivalent to c.70% within three generations. Within the most recent three-generation period (12.5 years; Bird <em>et al.</em> 2020), annual surveys indicate that the population declined by approximately 50-60% (Genz <em>et al.</em> 2022) and this is thought to continue given that the threats are ongoing. Although the size of the overall area containing detections of the species has not shown substantial change since 1998 (Genz <em>et al. </em>2022), there has reportedly been a decline of detections within sections of this area which has continued in the 2022-2023 annual surveys (C. Farmer <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2023).",

        "range": "This species is endemic to Kaua'i in the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>USA</strong>). It is common in the uplands including the Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve and especially in Kôke`e State Park, and an isolated population occurs in the Makaleha Mountains (USFWS 1983, Pratt 1993, Conant <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. Historically it ranged down to coastal elevations, as indicated by fossil evidence (P.

        "habitats": "Originally, it occurred in native forests throughout Kaua'i. Today, it occurs above 600 m in `ohi`a forest, but is commonest in western koa-`ohi`a forest (USFWS 1983, Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1987, Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. Preference for koa-`ohi`a may be attributable to koa itself (Conant <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, or the abundance of the introduced banana poka in the western parts of its range (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1985)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It feeds by gleaning insects from trunks and branches (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1987, Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and takes insects and nectar from flowers, apparently thriving on banana poka nectar (USFWS 1983, Conant <em>et al.</em> 1998, Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. It is also an active excavator, hammering and flaking off bark to locate arthropods underneath (T. Snetsinger <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>",
        "threats": "Clearance of the lowland forests on Kaua`i removed most of the habitat used by this species (USFWS 1983, Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. Current threats include predation from cats and rodents, disease (carried by introduced mosquitoes), ongoing habitat degradation by ungulates and invasive plants<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> </span>and (probably) competition from non-native birds (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 1998, P. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, J. M. Scott <em>in litt.</em> 1999, P. Roberts<em> in litt</em>. 2007, Paxton <em>et al. </em>2018)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Introduced mosquitoes, which spread avian pox and malaria, are now common at 900 m, and may be breeding as high as 1,200 m elevation (<span lang=\"EN-US\">Glad and Crampton 2015)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>. Climate change is projected to cause an increase in the elevation below which transmission of avian malaria occurs (Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Under a 2<sup>o</sup>C warming scenario and an increase in rainfall over high-elevation forests during the next 100 years, in keeping with climate model predictions for the region, the prevalence of malaria on Kaua`i is predicted to increase within the remaining habitat (Benning&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The 17&#160;<sup>o</sup>C isotherm, below which&#160;<em>Plasmodium</em>&#160;prevalence peaks, is predicted to shift upwards by around 300 m, decreasing the area of forest where&#160;<em>Plasmodium</em>&#160;prevalence is limited by 85% (Benning&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;<span lang=\"EN-US\">Such changes are already associated with increased prevalence of avian malaria in this species (Atkinson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014) and the species' range is contracting (Paxton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<span lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&#160;High densities of this species in an area containing avian malaria has previously suggested some level of resistance (Foster <em>et al</em>. 2004), but the species is currently undergoing steep declines and considered vulnerable to extinction from increasing disease prevalence (Paxton <em>et al.</em> 2020, 2022)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Feral pigs facilitate the spread of both alien plants and mosquitoes and, with other ungulates, continue to degrade native forests (Pratt 1994, VanderWerf 2012)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;Invasive plants have degraded significant portions of Kôke`e State Park and threaten the remainder of the habitat (P. Roberts&#160;<em>in lit</em>t. 2007,&#160;<span lang=\"EN-US\">Behnke&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). In addition to exacerbating the threat of introduced diseases, climate change is predicted to increase the geographic extent and intensity of habitat loss, invasive plants and non-native predators (Paxton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). This species' restriction to Kaua`i and dependence on canopy species makes it vulnerable to catastrophic events such as hurricanes (P. Roberts&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2007) which have caused substantial declines in the past (Pratt 1993, 1994).&#160;The emergence of the&#160;<em>Ceratocystis</em>&#160;wilt pathogen that causes rapid ‘ohi‘a death<em>&#160;</em>may also be a potential threat (Camp&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).</span></span></span>",

Donaldson&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999, Foster&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>, with the estimated population in the Alaka`i and Kôke`e areas increasing significantly to around 42,000 individuals in 2000 (Foster&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>.&#160;<span lang=\"EN-US\">However, estimates in 2012 indicated dramatic declines since 2000 of 91% in the core range and 98% in the periphery, with a resultant population estimate of only 6,519 individuals&#160;<span lang=\"EN-US\">(95% CI: 4,844– 8,495; Paxton&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;The most recent population estimate of 6,987 individuals suggests an overall decline of c.57% within the time period 2008-2018 (Paxton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), with declines exceeding 60% in interior forest. As such, the rate of decline is placed here in the range 55-70% within ten years.</span>",

        "range": "This species is endemic to O'ahu in the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>USA</strong>). It originally occurred throughout the island, but is now restricted to the two mountain ranges. In the Wai'anae Mountains, it is uncommon and sparsely distributed, mostly above 500 m elevation. In the southern and central Ko'olau Mountains, it is locally common, occurring from the summits occasionally down to 30 m in valleys, but it becomes increasingly rare northwards and is practically absent from the northern tip of the range (Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.",
        "population": "The population was estimated at  51,800 (46,500–57,100), based on a survey in 1991, with extrapolation of the observed densities to occupied habitat on the Ko`olau range and south Wai`anae region yielding estimated populations of about 49,500&#160;±&#160;4,400 and 2,300&#160;±&#160;900, respectively (Camp <em>et al.</em> 2009). This is placed in the band 40,000-60,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 30,000-40,000 mature individuals. However,&#160;surveys on O`ahu, unlike those on other Hawaiian islands, have not been systematic, and these estimates may be too high (R. Shallenberger&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999). During surveys of the O‘ahu Forest National Wildlife Refuge in 2011, the species was not observed in sufficient numbers to estimate population densities and larger scale surveys are warranted (Camp <em>et al.</em> 2011).",
        "habitats": "It has adapted relatively well to forests of non-native trees, but is most abundant in native forests, particularly where koa trees dominate (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It nests and forages in urban areas where enough trees grow (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Little is known about its diet, but it probably feeds primarily on small insects and other arthropods, taking nectar and fruit as secondary food sources (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.<p></p>",
        "threats": "Feral ungulates and introduced predators are likely to have contributed to historical declines (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and to be continuing limiting factors. There is thought to be continued loss of much of the remaining areas of lowland native habitats to development and invasive plants (Camp<em> et al. </em>2009). Diseases spread by introduced mosquitoes were probably also a major factor, but some populations have developed some degree of resistance to avian malaria such that they can persist at lower elevations, and this may explain recent population increases in lowland areas (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 1998, 2020; Krend 2011)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Avian pox is potentially another threat to the species (Lindsey <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).<p></p>",

Monitor the population. <br/>Protect high-elevation habitat as well as habitat at lower elevations to ensure that the existing disease-tolerant genotypes evolve and retain the potential to survive as founders for recovering bird populations (Camp <em>et al.</em> 2009).

However, the current trend is not known. <br/>The species was not observed in sufficient numbers during surveys in 2011 to estimate population densities (Camp <em>et al. </em>2011). Increasing the numbers of stations sampled will be necessary to reduce uncertainty and yield greater power to detect trends in this species (Camp <em>et al.</em> 2011).",

        "range": "<em>Myadestes obscurus</em> is endemic to Hawai'i in the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>USA</strong>) where it formerly occurred almost throughout the island. It is now restricted to the southern and eastern slopes of the island, largely above 1,000 m, c.25-30% of its former range (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, Wakelee and Fancy 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Here the species is encountered regularly in forests with some native tree component (R. Camp <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The population may be divided by the deforested rangeland of the Kapapala Tract, and a third possibly disjunct population exists above 2000 m on Mauna Loa (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1987)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, where it is widespread in suitable habitat (T. Pratt<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.<p></p>",
        "population": "The population was estimated to total c.170,000 birds based on surveys in 1976-1979 (Scott <em>et al. </em>1986), including 56,000 ± 3,000 in Ka'ü, on southern slope of Mauna Loa Volcano, which may be separate from the 113,000 ±&#160;3,000 in remainder of range because of deforested rangeland in Kapäpala tract (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986). 13,620 (95% CI: 9,581–19,645) individuals are estimated to occur in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (Kendall&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2022). The global population estimate is roughly equivalent to 110,000 mature individuals overall.",
        "habitats": "It favours mesic and wet native forests, but is also found at much lower densities in scrub and savanna habitats, especially where `ohi`a and koa trees are present. It occurs in some areas where introduced plants dominate, but is absent in others, its range being negatively correlated with the widespread exotic banana poka. It feeds primarily on fruit and berries, but also on insects (especially caterpillars), snails and fleshy flower bracts of the `ie`ie vine (Berger 1972, Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species plays an important role as a seed disperser of native plants and its absence from areas where it once occurred may be limiting the regeneration of native understorey (L. Pejchar <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>",
        "threats": "Habitat clearance for development, firewood, timber, croplands and pasture inevitably caused considerable contractions in this species' range, with most forests below 800 m having been converted to agricultural or urban uses. The spread of feral ungulates into native forests has caused habitat degradation, and in some areas non-native plants have replaced the natural habitat (USFWS and Hawai`i Forest Bird Recovery Team 1982, Loope and Medeiros 1995)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Feral pigs <em>Sus domesticus</em> are particularly disruptive and facilitate the spread of introduced, disease-carrying mosquitoes (USFWS and Hawai`i Forest Bird Recovery Team 1982, Anderson and Stone 1993)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Pigs also damage and destroy understorey plants that provide the fruit resources that the species depends upon (L. Pejchar <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Current avian predators include Hawaiian Hawk&#160;<em>Buteo solitarius,</em>&#160;Hawaiian Short-eared Owl&#160;<em>Asio flammeus sandwichensis</em>&#160;and Barn Owl <em>Tyto alba</em>. Introduced mammalian predators including rats <em>Rattus </em>spp., cats<em> Felis catus</em> and mongooses&#160;<em>Herpestes auropunctatus&#160;</em>are a further significant limiting factor (Wakelee and Fancy 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Avian malaria and avian poxvirus have likely contributed to the disappearance of this species from areas of its former range and continue to be threats, although prevalence of avian malaria is low and the persistence of some lower elevation populations suggests that some individuals&#160;are resistant to or at least tolerant of current strains of avian pox and malaria&#160;(Wakelee and Fancy 2020). Ectoparasites, particularly chewing lice, are thought to be an additional threat (Freed&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>It occurs in a number of important and well managed protected areas, such as the Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park (Wakelee and Fancy 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. During the 1990s, efforts were made to reduce the feral pig population by Hawaiian conservation authorities and private landowners (Anderson and Stone 1993).&#160;Reforestation of upland pastures is ongoing (T. Pratt<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. There is considerable interest in re-establishing the species on the western slopes of the island (T. Pratt<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Large areas have been fenced to exclude feral ungulates, and control and removal is ongoing (Wakelee and Fancy 2020).&#160;Control of alien mammalian predators such as rats and feral cats has been attempted in only a few areas using ground-based control methods (Wakelee and Fancy 2020).&#160;Larger-scale efforts involving aerial drops of toxicants to control rodents are being planned (Wakelee and Fancy 2020).<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Carry out surveys to obtain an up-to-date estimate for the population size. Determine whether there is a genetic or immunological basis for disease  resistance by some individuals (Wakelee and Fancy 2020). Monitor population trends through regular surveys. <br/>Control mammalian predators, including cats, mongooses and rats, effectively and continuously because of rapid rates of recolonisation and reproduction (Wakelee and Fancy 1999, 2020)<strong></strong>. Eradicate feral ungulates, including cattle and pigs, and exclude them from protected areas of forest (Wakelee and Fancy 2020)<strong></strong>. Improve methods for controlling avian disease (Wakelee and Fancy 2020). Consider reintroducing the species to several montane sites in the Kau and Kona districts to increase the number of subpopulations, increasing the resilience of the species, and potentially speeding up the recovery of important understorey plants (L. Pejchar <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. <p></p>",

There is no information on trend of individuals found above the tree line and no changes in distribution have been detected since the late 1970s (Wakelee and Fancy 2020). A recent&#160;analysis of annual population density estimates in the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, which supports 8% of the global population,&#160;showed an overall downwards trend in closed forest in the time period 1999-2019 and an increasing trend in the most recent decade 2010-2019 (Kendall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2022).

        "population": "The most recent total population estimate was 207,270 + 7,962 birds in 1986 (Scott <em>et al. </em>1986, Gorresen<em> et al.</em><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"> </span>2009), roughly equivalent to 140,000 mature individuals. There are three recognised subspecies, but variation in appearance is clinal and there is broad overlap (VanderWerf 2011). Population estimates for each subspecies are as follows: <em>bryani</em> c.2,500 birds in 1983; <em>sandwichensis </em>c.63,000 birds in 1983; and <em>ridgwayi</em> c.150,000 birds in 1976-1979 (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986).<p></p>",
        "habitats": "Subspecies <em>bryani</em> occupies arid, mostly high-altitude mamane and mamane-naio woodland, whilst <em>sandwichensis</em> occurs in mesic habitats on western and south-western slopes, and <em>ridgwayi</em> is restricted to wet, eastern slopes (Pratt 1980, Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, VanderWerf 1998)<strong></strong>. It feeds on insects and other invertebrates (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. <p></p>",
        "threats": "Loss of native forest habitats to urbanisation, agriculture and logging has decreased the overall range in many areas (Scott <em>et al. </em>1986). The habitat of <em>bryani</em> has been heavily browsed by feral ungulates, and introduced grasses suppress regeneration and potentially increase the risk of fire (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. Density is lower in disturbed forest, and ungulates, invasive introduced plants and climate change are thought to be causing declines in habitat quality within the range (VanderWerf 2012, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2013, USFWS 2020).  Diseases, such as avian pox and malaria, spread by mosquitoes, are a problem at low and middle elevations, increasing mortality and possibly preventing birds from nesting (E. VanderWerf <em>in litt</em>. 1999, VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2006), although elepaios have greater immunity to introduced mosquito-borne diseases than most of the Hawaiian honeycreepers&#160;(VanderWerf 2020).&#160;Current avian predators include Hawaiian Hawk&#160;<em>Buteo solitarius,</em>&#160;Hawaiian Short-eared Owl&#160;<em>Asio flammeus sandwichensis</em>&#160;and Barn Owl&#160;<em>Tyto alba</em> (VanderWerf 2020). Introduced mammalian predators including rats, cats<em>&#160;Felis catus</em>&#160;and mongooses&#160;<em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em> are additional threats (Banko<em> et al. </em>2019, VanderWerf 2020)<em>.&#160;</em>It has been suggested that the species may also suffer increased mortality associated with infection by chewing lice (Phthiraptera) (Freed <em>et al</em>. 2008).  It remains vulnerable to future catastrophic events such as hurricanes (E. VanderWerf <em>in litt</em>. 2012).<br/><p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong>This species has benefitted from conservation measured targeted at endangered honeycreepers on the island, particularly habitat protection and management (VanderWerf 2012, 2020).&#160;Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge,&#160;Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Ka‘u and Kapapala forest reserves.&#160;Ola'a-Kilauea Management Area and the Pu'u Wa'awa'a State Forest Bird Sanctuary&#160;protect areas of important habitat for endangered honeycreepers and other forest birds (VanderWerf 2020).&#160;Restoration and management actions include fencing, ungulate eradication, limited predator control, forest restoration, and habitat monitoring (VanderWerf 2020). Control of invasive Black Rats has resulted in increased nesting success of Hawaii Elepaio (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Carry out surveys to obtain an up-to-date estimate of the species' total population size. Continue research in the fields of genomic technologies and genetically  modified mosquitoes for disease control and their field application  (USFWS 2020). Monitor population trends.

        "rationale": "This species has a restricted range on one island where habitat degradation is ongoing and the population, though not especially small, is inferred to be in decline. It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.<p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "Surveys in the Central Windward region of Hawai`i from 1977 to 2003 indicate that the species was stable at high elevations and declining at low elevations (Gorresen <em>et al.</em> 2005). Since the 1980s density has decreased in leeward and mid-elevation windward areas (Gorresen <em>et al. </em>2009).&#160;There is also evidence of a decline in the Ka`u region between 1976 and 2005 (Tweed<em> et al.</em> 2007). Its disappearance from Pohakuloa Training Area  was recently noted (VanderWerf<em> </em>2011), and declines have been detected in high elevation mamane-naio forests (E. VanderWerf<em> in litt</em>. 2011).&#160;In Pu‘u ‘O ‘Umi Natural Area Reserve on Kohala, surveys in 1979 and 2017 indicated a density decline of 8.4% (Burnett<em> et al.</em> 2021). Additionally, the species declined in the proportion of stations detected during&#160;1998–2011 surveys in subalpine woodland habitat on Mauna Kea Volcano (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2013). A recent&#160;analysis of annual population density estimates in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, with this region supporting 14% of the global population, showed that trends were inconclusive across all strata (open forest, closed forest and pasture)&#160;in the most recent decade 2010-2019 (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2022). However density in closed forest alone declined by approximately 25% in the last three generations (Kendall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2022). Given that the threats to this species have not ceased, the population is precautionarily inferred to be declining overall although the rate has not been quantified.",

        "habitats": "The species is most abundant in wet to mesic montane forest, also occurring in mesic woodland at lower densities. It feeds on insects and other invertebrates (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>.&#160;In high-elevation native wet forests breeding begins at least by mid-February, and possibly earlier (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2016). Both males and females incubate and brood and provision nestlings, with nests being placed in a variety of native trees including ‘Ōhi‘a, ‛Ōlapa, ‛Ōhelo, Alani, Kanawao, Kāwa‛u, and Lapalapa, with mean nest height being low compared to other native arboreal cup nesters on Kaua‛i at 5.1 &#160;± 2.2 m SD (Hammond 2016). The species&#160;is better able to adapt to introduced forest dominated by non-native plant species&#160;than most native Hawaiian passerines (VanderWerf 2020).<p></p>",
        "threats": "Loss of native forest habitats to urbanisation, agriculture, and logging has decreased overall range in many areas (Scott&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1986). Diseases, such as avian pox and malaria, spread by mosquitoes, are a problem at all elevations, increasing mortality and possibly preventing birds from nesting (E. VanderWerf <em>in litt</em>. 1999, USFWS 2001, VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2006), although elepaios have greater immunity to introduced mosquito-borne diseases than most of the Hawaiian honeycreepers (VanderWerf 2020). Prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases&#160;is likely to increase with climate change (Atkinson <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Habitat degradation as a result of invasive alien plants and ungulates is ongoing (Behnke <em>et al. </em>2016, VanderWerf 2020). Avian predators include Hawaiian Short-eared Owl&#160;<em>Asio flammeus sandwichensis</em>&#160;and Barn Owl&#160;<em>Tyto alba</em>&#160;(VanderWerf 2020). Introduced mammalian predators are a further threat, such as feral cats (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Felis catus</span>) and rats (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Rattus </span>spp.), and the rate of nest depredation is higher in this species than in other forest species&#160;(Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species' restriction to Kaua'i also makes it vulnerable to catastrophic events such as hurricanes (P. Roberts&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2007) which have caused substantial declines in the past (Pratt 1993, 1994).",

Weed control has been conducted by The Nature Conservancy and Kōke‘e Resource Conservation Program (VanderWerf 2012).&#160;Since 2014, expanding grids of Goodnature A24 rat traps have protected nests and breeding birds in the core of its range (L. Crampton <em>in litt. </em>2016). Ungulate-proof fences have been erected and are continuing to be erected in core habitat, and will help prevent further habitat degradation from weeds (L.

Within the three generations (15.7 years; Bird <em>et al. </em>2020) to 2018, density increased in interior forest by c.36% and decreased in exterior forest by c.34%.

        "range": "<em>Chasiempis ibidis</em> is endemic to O'ahu in the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>USA</strong>).<p></p>",
        "population": "The total population was estimated at 1,261 mature individuals (95% CI=1,205-1,317) following surveys conducted from 2011-2012 (VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2013), consisting of about 477 breeding pairs and 307 single males. This total includes 592 males (95% CI= 554-630) and 369 females in the Ko'olau Mountains and 192 males and 84 females in the Wai' anae Mountains (VanderWerf <em>et al</em>. 2011a, 2013). The genetically effective population size may be even lower because of the fragmented distribution (VanderWerf&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, 2013)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/>The largest subpopulations are in the central (523 mature individuals) and southeastern Ko’olau (403&#160;mature individuals) Mountains, with smaller subpopulations in ‘Ekahanui (100&#160;mature individuals), Schofield  Barracks West Range (104&#160;mature individuals), Palehua (41&#160;mature individuals), Waikane and Kahana Valleys (24&#160;mature individuals),  and several tiny fragments containing 1-5 mature individuals each (VanderWerf 2012a).",
        "habitats": "The species is most abundant in mesic forest in valleys (VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2001)<strong></strong>, preferring mixed-species forest with a tall canopy and well-developed understorey, at 200-800 m (VanderWerf <em>et al. </em>2001)<strong></strong>. The species is less common in drier forest (Vanderwerf 1998)<strong></strong>. It feeds on insects and other invertebrates (VanderWerf 1998)<strong></strong>. <p></p>",
        "threats": "Habitat loss to development has been extensive, with 56% of its former range lost to agricultural or urban development (VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2001), though most areas where the species still occurs are zoned for conservation and are protected from development. The primary threats responsible for the decline of the species are nest predation by alien Black Rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) and mosquito-borne diseases (VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/>Nest-predation by black rats&#160;is the most serious current problem (VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 1997, 2001; VanderWerf 1998, 2009)<strong></strong>, leading to a male-biased sex ratio (VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2001)<strong></strong>. Feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> and mongooses <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>  are additional predators. Invasive alien plants promote high rat  abundance because many alien trees bear fruit or nuts  that are  attractive to rats (VanderWerf 2009). Fires are known to destroy key  habitat and promote the spread of alien plants on O'ahu (USFWS 2006),  with negative consequences for nest success (VanderWerf 2009). Feral  pigs <em>Sus scrofa</em>&#160;also facilitate the spread of invasive alien plants.<br/>Diseases such as avian pox and malaria are a problem throughout its range given that there are no high elevation refugia, increasing mortality of adults by c.10-25% and possibly preventing birds from nesting (E. VanderWerf <em>in litt</em>. 1999, VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, ‘elepaios have greater immunity to introduced mosquito-borne diseases than most of the Hawaiian honeycreepers and the species has persisted despite high disease prevalence (VanderWerf 2012a). Malaria prevalence in the species has been recorded at 87%, with 36% of birds showing signs of avian pox (VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. High prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases and local declines in the species' population are associated with high rainfall (USFWS 2006, VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2006).",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Critical habitat has been designated on O'ahu (USFWS 2001). The species has benefitted from conservation measures targeted at endangered honeycreepers on the island, including fencing, ungulate control and&#160;forest restoration. Rat control in 1996-2008 resulted in a 25% increase in survival of breeding females and a 100% increase in reproductive success, stabilising studied populations (VanderWerf and Smith 2002, VanderWerf 2009). Further rat control has taken place at other populations, but efficacy has been variable (VanderWerf <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 2011b). Captive breeding has been suggested but is unlikely to be effective unless threats in the wild are adequately managed (E. VanderWerf <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt. </span>2016). Recent research has shown that nesting height of Oahu Elepaios is increasing through evolution by selection from rat predation, which has lead to an overall increase in nest success in at least one population (VanderWerf 2012b). Rat control is ongoing and in 2014, installing and maintaining large-scale trapping grids of Goodnature A24 traps were added to control measures (USFWS 2019). The use of aerial broadcast methods to control rats over a larger scale has begun in certain recovery areas (USFWS 2019).<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Investigate whether nesting height is increasing in other parts of the island.Conduct research into disease resistance (VanderWerf 2009). Continue to monitor population trends and demography of populations (USFWS 2019). Closely monitor the extent and quality of habitat. <br/>Protect remaining forest habitat (USFWS 2019). Protect forest from fires and development (USFWS 2006)<strong></strong>. Continue rodent control programs. Expand the implementation of large-scale rodent control through aerial broadcast measures (USFWS 2019). <br/><p></p>",

        "rationale": "<p>This species has a very small population size that is inferred to be declining primarily owing to nest predation by Black Rats, with no subpopulation exceeding 1,000 mature individuals. It is therefore assessed as Vulnerable.</p><p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "Surveys conducted in the 1990s produced evidence that the species had declined by more than 75% since 1975 and by approximately 96% since the arrival of humans (VanderWerf <em>et al. </em>2001). The species has continued to decline over much of its range, particularly in the Wai`anae mountains, where only 300 birds were found in 2006-2010 (VanderWerf&#160;<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span>&#160;2011a), and overall&#160;has declined in abundance by about 50% since the 1990s, when the population was estimated to be about 1,974 birds (VanderWerf&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001). Numbers have been shown to remain stable or increase in areas where rats are controlled (VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2013). The overall trend of the species in the Oʻahu Army Natural Resources Program (OANRP) recovery areas (Schofield Barracks Military Reservation, Ēkahanui Gulch in Honouliuli Forest Reserve, Palehua and Moanalua Valley) has remained somewhat stable between 2013-2018,&#160;likely due to effective predator control in these areas (USFWS 2019). In 2017 the number of ‘elepaios in the area where rats had been controlled in Pia Valley had declined somewhat since 2007, which was the last year of rodent control (VanderWerf 2017). Between 2013 and 2018, the number of pairs appears to have declined in Wailupe Valley (USFWS 2019).&#160;Little is known on the status of Oʻahu ʻElepaio outside of the OANRP recovery areas and Wailupe Valley, although populations continue to be limited by habitat loss, modification and avian disease and predation (USFWS 2019). It is likely that areas where rats are controlled serve as sources of emigrants that help to support adjacent areas where declines are ongoing due to high levels of predation (VanderWerf&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Given that stability of populations is heavily reliant on rodent control and that rats are not sufficiently controlled throughout the range (USFWS 2019), the population is inferred to be declining overall.",

Dutson <em>in litt.</em> 2023). It is common&#160;at least on Makira, Kolombangara, Guadalcanal and Bougainville, although uncommon on Santa Isabel (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1997, Collar and Boesman 2021).",
        "habitats": "It is usually found in lower montane forest, it occurs from sea-level to 1,350 m and in coconut plantations (Cain and Galbraith 1956, Diamond 1975, Schodde 1977, Buckingham <em>et al.</em> 1995, G. Dutson pers. obs. 1997-1998)<strong></strong>. It is commonest in flowering trees in primary hill forests (Dutson 2011). It may be nomadic and reliant on a combination of habitats at different altitudes. It feeds on pollen, nectar and some small fruits such as <em>Schefflera.  </em> <p></p>",
        "threats": "Forest loss is slow but ongoing within the range (per Global Forest Watch 2022); much of the lowland forest in its range has been or is scheduled to be logged. The cage-bird trade could threaten populations, although the severity of this threat is unclear.&#160;<p></p>",

Ensure the protection of significant areas of forest to provide suitable trees for nesting. Continue to control trade.   <p></p>",

The population trend is thought to be declining but does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size has not been quantified but is not thought to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure).

The species is more common at higher elevations and occurs in secondary forest and plantations, however, the rate of deforestation does not take into account logging and other degradation which may be driving declines (G. Dutson <em>in litt. </em>2023). The cage-bird trade could threaten populations, although the severity of this threat is unclear. The population trend is therefore tentatively suspected to be declining, placed here in the range 1-9% within three generations.",

        "range": "<em><em>Hypotaenidia immaculata</em> </em>is known to be extant on Santa Isabel and may be extant on Choiseul, <strong>Solomon Islands </strong>(Dutson 2011). It  is said to be locally common, notably along the Garana River where  three pairs were heard and one seen along a 2 km path, in 1998 (G.  Dutson pers. obs. 1998).<em><br/></em><p></p>",
        "population": "The population was suspected to number 2,500-9,999 mature individuals previously (G. Dutson&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2013), although this requires survey confirmation and the population size is here considered unknown. However, the species is described as generally rare or absent but locally common (Dutson 2011).",
        "habitats": "It is reported to be rare in primary forest on Isabel (there is no swamp-forest at this site) where it prefers dense, grassy thickets mixed with forest and secondary forest thickets, including abandoned gardens, especially close to rivers (Webb 1992, G. Dutson pers. obs. 1998). It may nest at any time of the year (Hadden 2002) and may do so near to streams (Webb 1992). It is said to be omnivorous (Webb 1992)<strong></strong> and has been observed wading into streams to feed (Hadden 2002)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>",
        "threats": "As a flightless species, it may be susceptible to predation by cats and dogs, exacerbated by incidental capture by hunting dogs and in traps, but it appears to survive, at least locally, close to villages and predators (Webb 1992, K. D. Bishop <em>in litt.</em> 1994)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.&#160; Lowland forest is being extensively logged throughout its range but the species may benefit, at least temporarily, from deforestation. <p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>No targeted actions for this species are known.<strong></strong><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Survey with playback of tape-recordings across it range. Survey its status through interviews with local villagers. Determine its occurrence on Choiseul. Ascertain its habitat requirements. Investigate threats and ecology through discussions with villagers. Reduce levels of trapping though community education programmes.&#160;  <p></p>",
        "use_trade": "The species may be hunted. Sometimes captured by hunting dogs and in traps set for Pacific Black Ducks&#160;<em>Anas superciliosa</em>&#160;(Taylor&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020).",
        "rationale": "This species may have a moderately small population (although this remains unconfirmed), however it appears to benefit from ongoing forest loss and degradation and its population may be stable or increasing. The species is therefore listed as Least Concern.<p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "While there is ongoing forest loss in its range (equivalent to c.8-10% over three generations [Global Forest Watch 2022, using Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] data and methods disclosed therein]), this species favours early successional habitats, especially dense grassy thickets mixed with secondary scrub and forest (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;It appears to persist close to villages and high densities of dogs (Webb 1992) and so these pressures are unlikely to be driving population declines.&#160;Consequently, there is no reason to suspect declines in response to forest loss. Overall, the population is suspected to be stable, though it may in fact be even increasing.",

        "range": "<em>Charmosyna multistriata</em> is a poorly-known New Guinea species, ranging from the Snow Mountains of Papua (formerly Irian Jaya), <strong>Indonesia</strong>, to Crater Mountain in <strong>Papua New Guinea </strong>(Coates 1985, Beehler <em>et al.</em> 1986, Mack and Wright 1996). It is known from very few localities but assessments of its range and populations are hindered by its presumed nomadic habits&#160;and a lack of recent survey effort across the Indonesian portion of its range (I. Woxvold <em>in litt. </em>2020). There are no recent records from Papua (K.&#160;D. Bishop <em>in litt.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. In Papua New Guinea, there are records from Crater Mountain (Mack and Wright 1996)<strong></strong>, Lake Kutubu (Woxvold <em>et al. </em>2019) and the upper Fly River area (I. Woxvold, unpubl. data),&#160;and there have been frequent records of up to 125 birds around Ok Tedi<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Gregory 1995)<strong></strong>.<br/><em> <p></p></em>",
        "population": "The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is described as generally rare, although secure and (at least formerly) fairly common in the Ok Tedi area of Papua New Guinea (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1997).&#160;The species’ range includes large areas of rugged and well-forested terrain that remain little surveyed (I. Woxvold <em>in litt. </em>2020).",
        "habitats": "It inhabits lower montane forest from 180&#160;to 1,770 m (Coates 1985), with one historical record at 80 m (Rand 1942). It has been observed in small groups (2-4 individuals) (Freeman and Freeman 2014)&#160;to flocks of up to 125 birds (Gregory 1995), and is presumed to nest in tree cavities (Warakai <em>et al.</em> 2013). It feeds at flowers of canopy trees and epiphytes (Pratt and Beehler 2015).",
        "threats": "Its habitat is locally under threat from logging and clearance for agriculture; however, large areas of forest remain across much of its range, and the rugged terrain present in many areas affords ongoing protection against some anthropogenic processes (I. Woxvold <em>in litt. </em>2020). Reports of the species in Ok Tedi dropped dramatically following the severe drought in 1997-1998 (P. Gregory <em>in litt.</em> 2010), suggesting the species may be susceptible to climate-driven change in the availability of flower/nectar resources (I. Woxvold <em>in litt. </em>2020). Some populations may be impacted by mining activity at Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea and at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, but the impacts of these developments are likely to be localised. The Ok Tedi open pit is mostly above the upper elevation limit reported for this species, and all or most Ok Tedi/Tabubil area records are from well below the pit site, but infrastructure and tailings from both mines may have localised influence on suitable habitat (I. Woxvold <em>in litt. </em>2020). It is probably tolerant of degraded and patchy forest. The species is not believed to be declining rapidly, and given (1) the large expanse of suitable remaining habitat, (2) the species’ presumed nomadic habits, and (3) the lack of survey effort across much of its range, it is reasonable to conclude that the overall population remains secure (I. Woxvold<em> in litt. </em>2020).",

Woxvold <em>in litt.</em> 2020).</a>&#160;Study patterns of movement in individuals to get a better idea of population size and habitat requirements. Ensure the protection of significant areas of forest at appropriate altitudes.   <p></p>",
        "use_trade": null,
        "rationale": "This species has a large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size has not been quantified, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.",
        "trend_justification": "There are almost no data on population trends. A sharp decline in records was reported from the Tabubil/Ok Tedi area, where flocks of up to 125 birds were once reported (Gregory 1995), since the severe 1997-98 El Niño drought (P. Gregory <em>in litt. </em>2010). Forest loss is low within the range, occurring at a rate equivalent to c.1% over three generations (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;[2013] and methods disclosed therein). Much of the southern slopes of the central range occupied by this species remain well-forested and the rugged terrain affords some protection against a subset of anthropogenic threats (I. Woxvold <em>in litt. </em>2020). The species is precautionarily suspected to be declining slowly, owing to localised habitat degradation and the effects of severe weather.",

It has a scattered distribution within the range and is known only from several localities, but may have been overlooked in some areas due to its similarity to <em>A. metallica</em> with which it sometimes associates. It therefore&#160;may prove to be more widespread (Beehler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1986, Coates 1990,<strong></strong>&#160;Burrows 1993<strong></strong>, Beehler and Bino 1995, Beehler and Pratt 2016)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.",
        "habitats": "It is a species of lowland forest, usually in riverine or alluvial lowlands, but also occurs in the hills to 580 m (Beehler and Bino 1995)<strong></strong>. It is a colonial nester, often with <em>A. metallica</em> (Pratt and Beehler 2015). It is presumed resident but possibly nomadic (Craig and Feare 2020).<p></p>",
        "threats": "This species may have a naturally small and scattered population that is locally under threat from logging and clearance for agriculture, as well as hunting. The one known breeding colony (of c.200 birds) was in a single large tree in a sparsely populated area; this was later cut down with villagers reporting that such colonies are sometimes destroyed by local human inhabitants, who collect adults, young and eggs for food (Safford 1996).<p></p>",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>None is known.   <p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Regularly monitor the population at selected sites. Attempt to study movement patterns of individuals to better understand movements and habitat requirements. Research its tolerance of logged and degraded forest. Protect significant areas of primary riverine and alluvial lowland forest, both at sites where it is known to occur, and more extensively within its known range. Raise awareness of the scarcity of this species locally and find ways to prevent the felling of nesting trees.   <p></p>",
        "use_trade": "Villagers have reported that colonies are sometimes destroyed by local human inhabitants, who collect adults, young and eggs for food (Safford 1996).",
        "rationale": "This species has a large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km² combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population size has not been quantified, and as such it does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). Despite the fact that the population trend may be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.<p></p>",
        "trend_justification": "There are no data on population trends; however, the species may be locally under threat from logging and clearance for agriculture. Remote sensing data (Global Forest Watch 2023, using Hansen <em>et al.</em> [2013] data and methods disclosed therein) indicate that forest loss in this species' range has been low in the three generations to 2021 (equivalent to c.1%), however the species is restricted to lowland forest&#160;and this figure does not take into account the additional impacts of degradation. Precautionarily therefore, given also evidence that the species may be hunted (Safford 1996), the species suspected to be declining slowly overall.",

The species has recently been observed near the locality of the type specimen along the Ile-ile track in the Tentolo-Matinan Mountains (Rasmussen 2016). However there do not seem to be records from anywhere else, nor further specimens. High altitude areas seem poorly studied (or reported) in this region. The area of habitat above 1,500 m within the species’ range may actually be very small, and there do not appear to be records for the few locations that are visited often (Gunung Ambang and Mahawu for example). Accordingly, the species may only occur within a very restricted range within the Tentolo-Matinan Mountains.",
        "population": "The global population size has not been quantified, but the <em>Heinrichia </em>superspecies is described as generally uncommon, being more numerous at the upper end of the altitudinal range (Eaton <em>et al. </em>2021).

Deforestation in the species' range has so far been very minimal (<em>c</em>. 0.1% forest loss in the 10 years to 2022 [Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2013) and methods disclosed therein]).",

        "range": "The species occurs in the lowlands of east <strong>Venezuela </strong>through the Guianan Shield south to the Rio Amazonas in <strong>Brazil</strong>.",
        "population": "The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is  described as uncommon to rare and occurring at low densities (Stotz <em>et al</em>. 1996, Marantz <em>et al</em>. 2021).",
        "habitats": "This species is mainly found in \"terra firme\", gallery or seasonally flooded forests, occasionally also in dry and savanna forests (Marantz <em>et al</em>. 2021). It is usually confined to the interior of mature and primary forest; it avoids young  secondary growth, but does occur in some older secondary habitats, edge and selectively cut forest (Marantz <em>et al</em>. 2021). Its  diet generally consists of small arthropods, with small vertebrates  occasionally taken when available. Breeding is poorly known, probably  occurring during the dry season; it has been speculated that only one  egg is laid and that the species has a low breeding success (del Hoyo <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 2003).",
        "threats": "The species is threatened by forest loss through logging activities and the expansion of the agricultural frontier.",

        "rationale": "This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.",
        "trend_justification": "The population is feared to be declining as a consequence of habitat loss. The  species is described as sensitive to habitat modification; despite some tolerance of selectively cut forest is it not found in young secondary stands (Marantz <em>et al</em>. 2021).Tree cover loss is low within the range, amounting to 3% over three generations (14.8 years; Global Forest Watch 2023, using Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). Given the species' sensitivity to forest degradation, population declines may be steeper than the rate of tree cover loss suggests; precautionarily, they are here placed in the band 1-9% over three generations.",
        "taxonomic_notes": "<em>Hylexetastes perrotii</em> and <em>H. uniformis</em> were previously lumped as <em>H. perrotii</em> (del Hoyo and Collar 2016) and prior to that split into <em>Hylexetastes perrotii</em> (Ridgely and Tudor 1994), <em>H. uniformis</em> (Ridgely and Tudor 1994) and <em>H. brigidai</em> (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 1995). However, the genetic analyses of Azuaje-Rodríguez <em>et al.</em> (2020) showed that despite close similarities in vocalisations, the genus is composed of three major lineages with diagnostic plumage differences (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 1995, Derryberry <em>et al.</em> 2012): <em>perrotii</em>, <em>stresemanni</em>, and <em>uniformis</em>.

        "range": "It appears to be confined to northern Sulawesi, <strong>Indonesia</strong>, where it is known from mountain ranges on the Minahasa Peninsula and in the island's centre. Sightings from elsewhere remain unconfirmed: for example those on Buton (see Sykes 2009) and southern Sulawesi (BirdLife International 2001). Berryman and Eaton (2020) did not detect it in the Mekongga range, where they extended the distribution of other nocturnal species, including <em>Ninox ios, </em>suggesting that its distribution may be genuinely confined to Minahasa and central Sulawesi, although more surveys here, and in East Sulawesi, are needed.",
        "population": "There are no empirical data available from which to estimate this species' population size and even qualitative estimations of its abundance are obfuscated by its remote distribution and by virtue of it being an infrequently observed, nocturnal species for which, until relatively recently, the vocalisations were not known (Yong <em>et al</em>. 2012). Even so, it is described as 'uncommon' in Eaton <em>et al</em>. (2021) and is evidently not an abundant species, although may be regularly observed at known, accessible sites (eBird 2023). Although a population size is not estimated herein, there is more than 100,000 km<sup>2</sup> of forest in its mapped range, such that even if a small percentage of this is occupied, the population size is unlikely to be small. With no known acting threats on the species, there is no evidence that the contemporary population size is significantly depleted from a historic baseline.",
        "habitats": "It inhabits tropical lowland and lower montane, evergreen rainforest, from 250 m to 2,500 m (Yong&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021), although most records are from above 1,000 m. It is presumed to be sedentary in primary forest, including clearings and tracks through them. It has been found incubating in March to October (Boon and Faustino 2005, Yong&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, eBird 2023).<p></p>",
        "threats": "The only threat known to be acting on this species is habitat loss and degradation because of encroaching agriculture. In the past three generations (15 years: 2007-2022), forest cover has reduced by only 2-3% in this species' range, and some of these losses are attributable to natural phenomena including landslides (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein).&#160;This species' range is mostly contained within forest that is considered the least susceptible to exploitation in the future (see Voigt&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021), and declines are therefore unlikely to accelerate in the future.<p></p>",

Even unprotected areas of this species' range are secure however due to the remoteness of the terrain.<br/>&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Confirm the true limits of this species' distribution, especially surveys to determine whether it occurs in East or South-East Sulawesi provinces. Determine whether there are any other threats to this species beyond habitat loss and degradation. Continue to monitor habitat trends using remote sensing data. Propose further forested areas supporting populations of this, and other species endemic to Sulawesi, for protection.<br/><p></p>",

Accordingly, it is listed as Least Concern.<p></p>",

In the past three generations (15 years: 2007-2022), forest cover has reduced by only 2-3% in this species' range, and some of these losses are attributable to natural phenomena including landslides (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). This species appears dependent on primary forest, even if it strays over clearings and tracks when foraging (Yong <em>et al</em>. 2012, Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021), and these minor losses are suspected of causing a very slow, ongoing decline. Nonetheless, these declines are unlikely to be occurring at a rate that exceeds 5% over three generations. The range of <em>E. diabolicus</em> is mostly contained to forest that is considered the least susceptible to exploitation in the future (see Voigt <em>et al</em>. 2021), and declines are therefore unlikely to accelerate in the future.",

        "range": "It is endemic to Java and Bali, <strong>Indonesia</strong>, where it is represented by two subspecies: (1) nominotypical <em>montanus </em>on several mountains in West and Central Java (Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021, eBird 2023, Marsden <em>et al</em>. 2023); and (2) <em>ottolanderi </em>in East Java and Bali (Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021, eBird 2023). An introduced population on Mt Rinjani, Lombok, originates from escapes.",
        "population": "The population size of this species has not been estimated. The area of suitable habitat is large, however occupancy is demonstrably low (eBird 2023, Marsden <em>et al</em>. 2023) and there is strong evidence that the wild population size is (at least locally) being suppressed by intense trapping pressure (see Population Trend). Descriptively its abundance was revised from&#160;'uncommon' (Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2016) to 'locally now rare' (Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021), although in the absence of empirical data from which to produce a numerically derived estimate, the population size is set here to unknown. Determining this value should be considered a priority for future research.",
        "habitats": "Ii inhabits montane forest between 1,000 and 2,200 m. It occurs in small noisy groups of less than 10 birds (unlike <em>P. bornensis, </em>which typically occurs singly or in pairs) (Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021).",
        "threats": "The only threat identified for this species is capture for the pet trade, with no indication that the extent of forest cover in its range has decreased (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2013, Global Forest Watch 2023). Although historically rare in market surveys (e.g., Chng <em>et al</em>. 2015), it has since become much more commonly observed in physical markets (Anon.&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2022) and online (Okarda&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2022). Given this is the only identified threat, it is considered wholly responsible for the rapid declines observed in wild populations (Marsden <em>et al</em>. 2023).&#160;This trade is entirely (or mostly) domestic, with no indication that birds are leaving Indonesia.",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong>None is known. The Asian Songbird Trade Specialist Group (ASTSG) lists this species in Tier 1 (those they consider most threatened by trade) and has recommended that this bird be protected under Indonesian law. Because (almost?) all trade in this species is domestic, international policy instruments such as CITES would be ineffectual for this species. No captive birds are currently held in Indonesia (Collar and Wirth 2022).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Needed</strong><strong><br/></strong>Continue to monitor population trends (<em>sensu </em>Marsden <em>et al</em>. 2023), preferably expanding these to East Java and Bali, from which robust population trends are currently lacking. Establish a captive breeding population in Indonesia if considered appropriate (Collar and Wirth 2022). Determine whether the introduced population on Lombok is having an impact on native species.",
        "use_trade": "Trapping for the Indonesian songbird trade is the principal threat to this species. Although historically rare in market surveys (e.g., Chng <em>et al</em>. 2015), it has since become much more commonly observed in physical markets (Anon. <em>in litt</em>. 2022) and online (Okarda <em>et al</em>. 2022). This trade is entirely (or mostly) domestic, with no indication that birds are leaving Indonesia.",
        "rationale": "This species, endemic to Java and Bali (Indonesia), is listed as Vulnerable. It is considered to be threatened with extinction because of capture for the cagebird trade, the only identified threat, which is suspected of having driven declines of <em>c</em>. 30–49% over the past ten years (2013–2023). This threat has driven even more severe declines in other species on Java, such that rates of decline must be urgently monitored.",
        "trend_justification": "Although not initially identified as a taxon at risk of extinction in Eaton <em>et al</em>. (2015), there is now evidence that this species has declined (potentially rapidly) over the past 1-2 decades in response to demand for the Indonesian songbird trade. Reviewing published market inventories, Collar and Wirth (2022) found no 'large numbers or [suggestion of] a sudden surge in the trade [of this species]'; however a comparison of Chng <em>et al</em>. (2015), who found 12 individuals in Jakarta's three markets (in 2014), with an equivalent survey undertake in 2019 (Anon. <em>in litt</em>. 2022), which found 174 birds across the same three markets, suggests that demand for this species may have increased rapidly. Using a web-scraping tool to mine data from online marketplace platforms, Okarda <em>et al</em>. (2022) found 42 listings of this species, indicating that this species is also widely traded online.<br/><br/>There is increasing evidence that demand for trade is causing ongoing declines in wild populations. The only empirical trend data available come from Marsden <em>et al</em>. (2023), who generated encounter rates for 12 mountains in West/Central Java and found the species to be rare, with an encounter rate of 0.06 (0.02-0.13) at occupied sites (<em>n</em>=4). Previous encounter rates are available for Gede–Pangrango (1981; 0.82), Puncak (1981; 0.90) and Slamet (1995; 1.05). Although neither Gede or Puncak were visited in the most recent surveys, the consistency of encounter rate between them (and with Slamet) suggest these are likely to have been representative values, and in any instance the rapid fall in encounter rate at Slamet fits the inferred trend of a potentially rapid fall in populations size. If the encounter rate is considered a reliable proxy for the rate of population trend, this would suggest a very rapid reduction (exceeding 80%) compared to 30-40 years ago. Given the rapid increase in demand for the species over the past 10 years (see above), much of this reduction is thought to have been recent. These data support other reports that the species has declined at some sites. At Gunung Gede, the species was encountered with regularity until <em>c</em>. 2016, after which it seems to have become scarcer, followed by near-total extirpation, with very few recent records despite intense effort (eBird 2023, J. Eaton <em>in litt</em>. 2023). Further east, the species appears to still be regularly encountered at several sites, although even at these there is weak evidence (eBird 2023) of an ongoing (but unquantifiable) decline in encounter rate over the past 5-6 years that is nonetheless likely to be at a shallower rate than sites surveyed further west. On Bali, the population trend (based on eBird 2023) appears to be relatively stable. Compiling an overall rate of decline is consequently difficult for <em>P. montanus</em>, and it must be considered that the most remote parts of its range are simultaneously those with the lowest trapping pressure and poorest ornithological survey effort. Following available data too strictly therefore risks overestimating the rate of decline. Nonetheless, a rapid rate of decline seems entirely possible with little of Java's forests considered truly remote from the intrusions of trappers, as demonstrated by the precipitous decline of other endemic bird species on the island (see, e.g., Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2015, Collar and Wirth 2022).<br/>Overall, rates of decline over the past ten years could span a range of 20-60% given the immense uncertainties surrounding available data, and rates at individual sites may even span 0-100%. Evaluating all data available, rates of decline are thought most likely to fall into the band 30-49% over the past ten years and are also suspected to hit the same rate of decline between 2016 and 2026, and in the next ten years (thus meeting the threshold for Vulnerable A2, A3 and A4).",
        "taxonomic_notes": "<em>Pomatorhinus montanus</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>P. bornensis</em>&#160;were previously lumped as&#160;<em>P. montanus</em>&#160;(Handbook of the Birds of the World and BirdLife International 2022) but are split on the basis of differences in plumage, vocalisations, habitat/elevation and behaviour (Eaton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), although further work is needed to clarify and better understand these differences. Recent molecular studies reveal the complexity of&#160;<em>Pomatorhinus</em>&#160;taxonomy (Dong&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Reddy and Moyle 2011), pointing to transfer of subspecies&#160;<em>nuchalis</em>,&#160;<em>difficilis</em>,&#160;<em>klossi</em>&#160;and “fastidiosus” of&#160;<em>P. schisticeps</em>&#160;to present species in one interpretation of evidence (Dickinson and Christidis 2014); however, these four forms differ so strongly in appearance, with longer bills, olive-brown vs bluish-grey crowns, olive-brown vs chestnut upperparts and unstreaked underparts, that their relationship with present species and status as conspecific require confirmation (independent species status might be appropriate). Two subspecies recognised."

        "population": "In this species' elevational range lies approximately 3,000 km<sup>2</sup> of forest (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). In the absence of a density estimate, deriving a population size estimate is not possible, although the moderate area of suitable habitat combined with qualitative descriptions of its abundance as 'fairly common' (Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021) indicate that its population size is unlikely to be especially small.",
        "habitats": "The species occurs in primary and degraded lowland forest; apparently confined to below 300 m. It is typically found singly or in pairs, where it sits unobtrusively.",
        "threats": "The principal threat to this species is forest loss, mostly in response to encroaching agriculture and towns in western Taliabu. This is thought to have caused population reductions equivalent to 1-12% over the past ten years, and a similar rate is suspected into the future.",
        "measures": "<strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong>Taliabu hosts only one protected area, 'Taliabu Island Nature Reserve', which protects forest that is mostly too high in elevation to confer benefit to this species (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2023).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Research this species' habitat tolerances. Determine a population size estimate by surveying density in different habitats. Continue to monitor habitat trends using remote sensing data as a proxy for population trend. Protect areas of lowland forest with community-led initiatives to ensure <em>C. colonus </em>and other Sula lowland endemics are adequately protected.",
        "use_trade": null,
        "rationale": "This species is endemic to the Sula Islands in Indonesia, where it has a moderately small Extent of Occurrence. Remote sensing data indicate that there is ongoing forest loss in Taliabu's lowlands, which is thought to be driving slow population declines. However, its population is not Severely Fragmented, nor occurs in a limited number of Locations, and appears tolerant of at least some habitat degradation. Accordingly, it is considered Near Threatened.",
        "trend_justification": "There are no population data available for this species from which to derive estimated rates of reduction. However, as a forest-dependent species (Eaton <em>et al</em>. 2021), its population size is thought to be relatively closely tied to the extent of available forest, thus rates of forest cover loss are here used as a proxy for population reduction. In the ten years to 2022, forest cover in this species' elevational range reduced by 7-12%, depending on the assumptions used (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen <em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). Given some tolerance for forest degradation, it is possible that these percentages may overestimate the impact of deforestation on population size, especially as many of these losses amount to localised forest incursions caused by the encroachment of agriculture. Consequently, between 2012 and 2022, the species is suspected of having declined by 1-12%. The annual rate of forest loss remained relatively steady over the past ten years (with an apparent fall in 2021), such that precautionarily the same rate of population loss is suspected in the next ten years. It is noted that most losses are from Taliabu, with minimal forest cover loss on Mangole and Sanana since 2000 (per Global Forest Watch 2023).",

Proposed subspecies&#160;<em>subsolanus</em>&#160;described from single specimen, now lost, originally believed to have been collected near Tonkean, in E Sulawesi (Coates and Bishop 1997), but recently its provenance was postulated as the Sula Is (Eaton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).

Surveys in Java reported 1-3 individuals observed per day at Gunung Salak and Gunung Slamet (Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2014), and recent surveys in West and Central Java (Marsden <em>et al</em>. 2023) encountered it on all twelve mountains surveyed, suggesting it is widespread and locally common. Given a relatively large area of suitable habitat (its range contains more than 20,000 km<sup>2</sup> of forest, to which this species is only moderately tied), even if only a small percentage of the range was occupied, the population size of <em>C. pulchellus </em>is unlikely to be especially small.",
        "habitats": "It occurs in montane and submontane forest at 800-2,100 m, favouring clearings and tracks within the forest and roosting&#160;on the ground or a low perch, often in thick tangles (Eaton <em>et al. </em>2021). Breeding season is late March to May on Java (N. Cleere <em>in litt. </em>2016). Its diet is poorly studied, but it is thought to feed on insects, foraging over forest clearings or near cliffs (Cleere and Kirwan 2020).&#160;<p></p>",
        "threats": "Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation as a result of logging and agricultural expansion is the only known threat to the species. Very little primary forest remains in the lowlands of Sumatra and Java, but larger patches exist in montane areas (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] and methods disclosed therein). These patches are at risk of habitat encroachment at lower elevations, with logging and agricultural expansion continuing and thought to be causing slow, significant declines.<br/><p></p>",

It is likely to be moderately secure in small numbers at higher elevations, but losing habitat at lower levels where encroachment is occurring. In the 11 years (three generations) to 2022, forest cover in the species' range declined by <em>c</em>. 5% (Global Forest Watch 2023, based on data from Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>.
